branches reaching up towards the sun, we continued our growth, both in resilience and in momentum to make the best of what lay in our path. Not only did we navigate successfully, the rocky road that impacted almost every aspect of our business, we were rewarded for our efforts and for our continued dedication by achieving above and beyond our expectations for the Company.

Discussion and Analysis\nRisk and Governance\nStatement of ESG Performance\nFinancial Reports\nAppendices\n ABOUT THE REPORT\nGRI 2-2, 3,4 & 5\nTalawakelle Tea Estates PLC (hereinafter \nreferred to as \u201cTTE\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) prepares and publishes its annual report to inform stakeholders of the Company\u2019s performance and prospects for a given financial year. \nSince 2013, TTE has published an integrated \nannual report.  The latest report, which is the Company\u2019s 9th integrated report covers the period 01st April 2022 to 31st March 2023 and coincides with the Company\u2019s financial reporting cycle.  \nThis report and all other previous integrated \nreports including the most recent past report for FY 2021/22 are available for viewing and download on our corporate website. \nwww.talawakelleteas.com\nSCOPE AND BOUNDARY\nThe overall boundary of this report \nencompasses TTE\u2019s operations at the Company\u2019s 16 estates and 15 factories as \nwell as the regional offices and the corporate office in Colombo. \nThe report covers both financial and \nnon-financial data along with information pertaining to TTE\u2019s strategy, business model, risk, governance, and ESG initiatives that may be of interest to stakeholders of the Company. In reporting on non-financial data, the report also makes reference to TTE\u2019s Subsidiaries operating hydropower energy generation.\nMATERIALITY AND THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE \nOur rigorous reporting process ensures that we focus on the most significant material issues that drive our value creation. We prioritize stakeholder engagement (pages 46 to 49), discussions within the TTE Board, \nManagement, and ESEG steering Committee, and the enterprise risk and opportunity management process (Page 44).

Shareholder,\nIt is my pleasure to present to you the 9th \nIntegrated Annual Report and Financial Statements of Talawakelle Tea Estates PLC (TTE) for the year ended 31st March 2023. Sri Lanka witnessed a year of extreme uncertainty and turbulence, as the country experienced the most acute economic crisis since independence, leading to political instability, social unrest and severe hardships for businesses and households. For TTE, the year was the ultimate test of resilience and adaptability, as our teams were called upon to respond to rapidly evolving challenges at an accelerated pace. Against this backdrop, I am delighted to report that TTE demonstrated its characteristic agility and strategic foresight to deliver a near three-fold growth in post-tax profits to Rs. 2.57 Bn.\nI believe there is only one word that can \naptly describe TTE\u2019s financial performance in these turbulent times - outstanding. Revenue nearly doubled to Rs. 8.13 Bn (2021/22: Rs. 4.66 Bn), reflecting strong prices at the Colombo Tea Auction as well as the Company\u2019s stellar reputation for quality and sustainability, which enabled it to yet again emerge as the highest price taker at the Auction. In addition to its impressive financial performance, I am humbled to see TTE asserting its leadership in other critical areas of the business, driving shared value creation across its operations. The Great Place to Work Survey 2023 ranked TTE among Sri Lanka\u2019s best employers while our relentless efforts to embed sustainability into all aspects of our business was recognised through numerous local and international awards.\nCONTEXT TO PERFORMANCE\nThe operating landscape during the year was dominated by the country\u2019s deepening macro-economic vulnerabilities, which resulted in Sri Lanka experiencing severe political and socio-economic stress. The country\u2019s economy contracted by 7.8% in 2022 as long-standing structural \neconomic imbalances were exacerbated by pandemic-led disruptions and global headwinds, which resulted in a balance of payments crisis and ultimately a sovereign debt default. Dwindling foreign currency reserves resulted in shortages in essential items, triggering an acute energy crisis that led to fuel shortages, prolonged power cuts and soaring inflation. The Government and Central Bank engaged in a series of policy interventions to restore macro-economic stability, which included unprecedented tightening of monetary policy which led to a sharp increase in interest rates. The Government also imposed restrictions on certain imports in a bid to limit the outflow of valuable foreign exchange. Inflation surged during the year, due to the combined effects of the Rupee depreciation, shortage in essential items and adjustments to administrative prices, resulting in the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) increasing by 50.3% during the year.\nMeanwhile, as described in further detail in \nthe Managing Director\u2019s Review on page 18, Sri Lanka\u2019s Tea industry experienced mixed fortunes during the year. While production declined during the year, the industry benefitted from favourable pricing with auction prices nearly doubling during the calendar year 2022.\nTHREE DECADES OF SHARED VALUE \nCREATION\nAs we mark our 30th year of operations, \nwe have much to be proud of. Shared \nvalue creation is embedded in our DNA and over the past decades we have \ndemonstrated our commitment to driving \nthe socio-economic empowerment of our \necosystem of employees including estate workers and their families. We have also focused relentlessly on driving Sri Lanka\u2019s Tea industry forward through innovation, sustainability and ethical business.\nPremium quality Teas from our High-Grown \nand Low-Grown estates are amongst the most sought-after Tea in the world, giving \nSri Lanka much needed visibility in the global Tea supply chain. Indirectly, our Tea also brings in valuable foreign exchange by contributing 2% to the national Tea production.\nWith a 4,825-strong estate workforce, \nTTE also stands among the largest direct employers in the plantation sector. Given the macro-economic vulnerabilities that prevailed, we were acutely aware of the challenges faced by our team in maintaining living standards. Against this backdrop, swift interventions were made to ensure the financial and food security and well-being of not just our employees but over 42,000-estate communities residing in our estates. Total payments to employees thereby reached a record-high of Rs. 2.9 Bn during the year. Our most recent endeavour to support the financial empowerment of our estate workers is the revenue-share model introduced at the onset of the pandemic in 2020. In addition to developing micro-entrepreneurs within our estates, the revenue-share model is expected to contribute towards addressing the critical issue of labour-shortages within the plantation sector, thereby aiding labour retention through offering increased dignity of labour.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4942, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57a0128c-6e2c-4614-87b1-b8a453662c8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "57a0128c-6e2c-4614-87b1-b8a453662c8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f0d89ef2-300a-40ef-bd75-75009db18cc6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "1795e90dbc7e84e9c5e60fa670dadc9083dc8182d01970bd47f21621ef4e2fce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "609260cf-0b52-4bc8-aed9-697935ef174a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "20b25a5c8c1b7749ce5ccc38a1cddfb8532849ee027fb541d53dfe5119482322", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "With a 4,825-strong estate workforce, \nTTE also stands among the largest direct employers in the plantation sector.

As part of the Hayleys Group, TTE benefits from the multi-faceted leadership capabilities, robust governance standards and comprehensive policies of the Group. During the year, we relied heavily on these strengths to help reframe our responses to the current crisis. The Group Management Committee swiftly increased the frequency and scope of its meetings, dedicating adequate time to understand and respond to the rapidly changing operating landscape and implement necessary safeguards to preserve the Company\u2019s value creation. Having previously relied on Group Board Committees, TTE\u2019s governance structure was strengthened during the year, with the appointment of a dedicated Remuneration Committee, Related Party Transaction Review Committee and Nomination Committee which will provide more focused oversight on key matters. The Company has zero tolerance for corruption and I together with the Board of Directors remain committed to ensuring that the Company has in place the required governance structures and internal controls to mitigate the risk of corruption. During the year, the Company was also fully compliant to all relevant laws and regulations, including those pertaining to \nanti-corruption.\nSTRATEGIC ESG INTEGRATION\nGRI 2-22\nSustainability has always been part of our ethos, as we have remained true to our commitment to deliver shared and responsible value through innovation, environmental stewardship and strong governance. These fundamentals have shaped the way we manage our estates, use natural resources in manufacturing Tea and how we safeguard the rights of our people and communities. As a participant of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), we have also committed to the 10 principles. During the year, we achieved a major milestone in our sustainability and ESG journey by formalizing and launching our ESG Framework, clearly articulating our social, environmental and governance aspirations, targets and action plans. The Framework drives our \u2018Regenerative Business Agenda 2030\u2019 at the front and center of its ambitious aspirations, which will serve as both a vision and tool in revitalizing relationships between ecosystems, soil, humans and crops. Broadly aligned to the aspirations of the Hayleys Lifecode, the Regenerative agenda is expected to transform TTE\u2019s business in the medium-to-long term through rewiring strategy, decision-making and operational processes.The Company also strengthened its \nsustainability and ESG governance with the appointment of a new Environmental, Social, Economic and Governance (ESEG) Steering Committee, which will provide strategic oversight in rolling out the new ESG agenda. The Committee is chaired by TTE\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and comprises a cross functional team from diverse disciplines including environmental, operations, sustainable practices, legal, investor relations, corporate governance, and human capital.\nSHAREHOLDER VALUE CREATION\nThe Company delivered exceptional shareholder value during the year; with three interim dividends totaling Rs. 14 per share and a proposed fourth dividend of Rs.17.35 Accordingly, the Company\u2019s dividend per share for the year 2022-23 clocked in at Rs. 31.35 the highest in the Company\u2019s operating history.\nWAY FORWARD\nThe approval of an Extended Fund Facility by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) coupled with coordinated policy interventions to restore macro-economic stability have set Sri Lanka\u2019s economy on the road to recovery. We are cognizant of short-term challenges but remain cautiously optimistic that the economy will gain momentum over the medium-term. Interest rates are expected to record a gradual decline towards the latter part of 2023, while the Sri Lankan Rupee is anticipated to gradually stabilise reflecting improved market sentiments and gradual restoration of macro-economic stability. While Tea production levels are expected to recover in 2023, high input costs remain a critical concern as consistently high prices could affect the country\u2019s competitiveness in the international Tea market.

It was therefore extremely disconcerting to see Sri Lanka engulfed by an unprecedented economic crisis with the resultant socio-economic and political upheaval challenging all sectors of the economy.\nAgainst this backdrop, I am pleased \nto report that Talawakelle Tea Estates PLC (TTE) has yet again demonstrated its resilience, recording outstanding triple bottom line performance, having overcome what many thought would be insurmountable challenges.\nI would like to take this opportunity to \nsummarise a few key highlights. TTE was yet again Ranked No. 1 overall in the National Sales Average (NSA) amongst the Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) at the Colombo Tea Auctions. Our Tea production volumes reached 5.1 Mn kg in the year under review, denoting a 14% contraction over the previous financial year, while Revenue surpassed all expected targets, growing from Rs. 4.66 Bn in the previous financial year to Rs. 8.13 Bn in the current financial year, reflecting a phenomenal 74.37% growth year on year. This was achieved through focusing primarily on high-quality premium Teas that command a Rs 102.78 premium over the National Sales Average. Meanwhile, despite substantial cost escalations, healthy margins together with higher interest income enabled a near four-fold increase in PBT to Rs. 3.29 Bn in Financial Year 2022/23 from the Rs. 833 Mn tabled the year before.\nSTRATEGIC REORIENTATION\nAs the economic crisis in the country began to unfold, it was abundantly clear that all our operations will be impacted in one way or the other. This understanding motivated our teams to work together and address emerging challenges with agility and determination. Seeking the support and guidance of the Group Management Committee, we formulated and executed \ncontingency plans for all mission critical activities with a view to improving our preparedness against unforeseen business disruptions. We were thus able to ensure adequate fuel reserves and availability of other essentials to maintain continuity of operations year-round. The fact that no lost days were recorded in the current financial year, I believe, is a clear testament to our foresight and commitment to stay focused on the continuity of our business. Equally importantly it was also a huge morale booster for our workforce in these uncertain times.\nDriving productivity and efficiency \nimprovements were key strategic imperatives during the year, with precision agriculture techniques introduced to optimise agricultural inputs, maximise yields and improve land productivity.\nI am also very pleased to see \nconstruction work on the new state-of-the-art Kiruwanaganga factory nearing completion. The new factory represents a relocation of the previous facility and features modern machinery and advanced infrastructure which will enable the highly efficient production of superior quality produce. The factory is expected to be completed in the 2nd half of 2023 and has the capacity to produce 800,000 kg of Made Tea annually.While further sharpening our core \ncompetencies, our crop diversification efforts also gathered momentum. First initiated over a decade ago as part of a broad-based effort to develop alternative revenue streams, TTE has focused on investing in less labour intensive crops such as coconut and cinnamon. In total 35.24 hectares of Coconut and 46.91 hectares of cinnamon have been cultivated to date.\nSHARING THE BURDEN OF PEOPLE \nAND COMMUNITIES\nGoing beyond the call of duty we \nsupported people throughout the crisis. To combat the impact of fuel scarcity, additional resources were allocated to ensure food stocks and provisions for a minimum of 2 months were available on-site at all our estates to meet the needs of our workforce and the wider estate communities. We also actively encouraged employees to participate in the revenue share model to supplement their livelihoods. The revenue share model was later opened up to non-employees as well.\nA special home gardening project was \nrolled out across all estates to motivate the wider community to undertake growing activities to alleviate concerns regarding food security.\n\u201cI am indeed pleased to announce that \nTTE\u2019s progress on all fronts continues to be endorsed by esteemed awarding bodies both locally and internationally.\u201dOverview\nManagement Discussion and Analysis\nRisk and Governance\nStatement of ESG Performance\nFinancial Reports\nAppendices19\nTALAWAKELLE TEA ESTATES PLC\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL  REPORT 2022/23", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4624, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f5b33fe-1cb2-449b-a5dc-84c56ba2a52a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f5b33fe-1cb2-449b-a5dc-84c56ba2a52a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2a148470-9421-496a-b928-dd721e911300", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "1494cd098e7fa2e254b125340ca941fdba886faa0e5351c38bd73b5a70d562c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ea9d182e-cf5a-40db-889a-d4d8a7d51582", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2565f34bd6f1b7898c7e540785f879221e3cd3caa257774484844de60517e128", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "20\nTALAWAKELLE TEA ESTATES PLC\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL  REPORT 2022/23Overview\nManagement Discussion and Analysis\nRisk and Governance\nStatement of ESG Performance\nFinancial Reports\nAppendices\nWe continued to offer educational support \nto children in the community. Aside from our routine capacity building interventions, we arranged special transport services to be provided for students to travel to and from examination centers during the fuel shortage.\nMeanwhile, with labour migration \nbecoming a major challenge in the current year, we initiated multi-pronged approaches to secure the loyalty and commitment of the estate workforce. The existing attendance incentive scheme applicable for the estate workforce was revamped through a new tiered rewards scheme. The \u201cBest Harvester Programme\u201d was also aggressively promoted along with early morning and evening plucking to enable pluckers to supplement their regular income. Both the \u201cRevenue Share Model\u201d and the \u201cWeed Buy Back\u201d scheme also proved to be key tools in helping the workforce to increase their earning capacity.\nRs.165 Mn was invested in TTE\u2019s flagship \nprogramme, \u201cA Home for Every Plantation Worker\u201d towards the socio-economic development of its estate communities through the four pillars of \u2018Improving the Living Environment\u2019, \u2018Community Capacity Building\u2019, \u2018Health and Nutrition\u2019 and \u2018Youth Empowerment\u2019 Continuing to support the wellbeing of our estate community.\nThe \u201cMother and Child-friendly Tea \nPlantations\u201d is the other major umbrella project by Hayleys Plantations to which TTE has made a firm commitment in promoting maternal health, child nutrition and protection of child rights. Amidst the prevailing economic crisis, we tightened monitoring of childhood development indicators, especially malnutrition and infant mortality.DEEPENING OUR FOCUS ON \nSUSTAINABILITY\nFor TTE sustainability means putting into \npractice, our core principles as a plantation Company to preserve and protect the environment. TTE\u2019s estates operate under the RA\u2122 certification and Ecolabel-Tea certification while our factories are certified under the ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management Standards, ISO 50001:2018 Energy Management System, ISO 14064:1-2018 Greenhouse Gas Emission Management System, which have enabled us to implement industry-leading systems and standards to manage the environmental and climate related impacts of our business operations, encompassing soil nutrition to water, effluents energy and emissions.\nUnwilling to rely solely on these \nconventional approaches, we have always been emphatic about broadening our outlook to see how we can go beyond traditional sustainability practices to focus on creating systems that not only sustain, but also restore and regenerate natural resources. It is this collective conscience that led to the roll out of our 2030 Regenerative Agenda, through which we aim to promote sustainability and regenerative practices across all aspects of our business. Moving swiftly to implement our 2030 Regenerative Agenda, our organic soil enrichment programme was further strengthened with a view to improving the efficacy of compost distribution using slow release techniques to preserve long-term soil health. With the technique widely applied across estates in the current year, we are now seeing an improvement in the soil nutrient retention levels on our tea fields.\nAs part of the soil health management \nstrategy, TTE also partnered with the University of Kelaniya in a pilot project to explore the feasibility of introducing Bio-Char to improve the fertiliser absorption levels across our tea fields which would \nultimately reduce the volume of fertiliser applied and improve overall soil health over time. Research & Development activities were also accelerated with special emphasis on developing drought and pest resistant Tea cultivar.\nApart from this, TTE has always been \nactively involved in high impact biodiversity conservation initiatives. The St. Clair's Falls Ecosystem Restoration Project is one such ongoing initiative that TTE has been committed to for the past 05 years. Since 2021, we act as the project leader in the Hayleys Group flagship biodiversity conservation initiative \u2018KIRULU\u2019, which focuses on restoring biological ecosystems and preserving natural habitats within High Conservation Value Areas (HCVA).\nTTE remains a keen advocate of the \nWildlife Nature Protection Society PLANT (WNPS PLANT) project, a collaborative effort between the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society and Preserving Land and Nature (Guarantee) Ltd to establish bio diversity corridors and preserve forest ecosystems to safeguard Sri Lanka\u2019s unique biodiversity. As part of its commitment to the WNPS PLANT project, the Hayleys Plantation sector, including TTE and its sister companies have made a zero deforestation undertaking across its estates.

At the Asia Integrated Reporting Awards 2022, TTE secured the Overall Bronze award along with Gold awards in 3 categories.\nWAY FORWARD\nOur ability to generate extraordinary results in which was undoubtedly a challenging time, stands testament to TTE\u2019s adaptability to embrace any challenge. That said, let me reiterate that we are by no means content as we feel there is much room for improvement.\nIn the coming year, we expect to see a \ndecline in global Tea prices as consumer priorities shift on the back of weakening economic prospects. Amidst this backdrop I expect competitive pressure to intensify significantly, which would call for a more precision-driven approach to differentiation in order to stay ahead of the curve.\nTTE for its part is already in the process of \nputting in place a robust 5-pillar strategy that we hope will boost competencies across every aspect of the company\u2019s value chain from plot, plant to product, processes and people. We are also looking to go beyond sustainability to integrate ESG factors more deeply into our 5-pillar strategy, which we hope will strengthen business resilience and enable the Company to sharpen its competitive edge in the coming years.APPRECIATIONS\nBefore I conclude, I would like to express my appreciation to every single one of TTE's employees. I am profoundly grateful for your commitment towards the Company in what has been one of the most challenging periods in our 30 year history.\nI also wish to place on record my \nappreciation to our Corporate Management Team for going above and beyond to change the narrative in the face of adversity. I am indeed proud to serve alongside you.\nLet me take this opportunity to thank the \nChairman, the Board of Directors and the Group Management Committee for their tireless efforts that were instrumental in steering TTE through the challenges of this past year.\nFinally to our loyal shareholders, thank \nyou for staying on this journey with TTE.

By identifying the critical and significant material issues, which represent our most significant impacts on the economy, social, environment, people, and human rights with those material impact from those aspects to TTE, we are able to prioritise our actions based on these material issues to support our \"ReGen\" goals. ReGen is the acronym we use for our new \u201cRegenerative business agenda-2030\u201d purpose that is driving TTE \nto go beyond the current sustainability-based business model to embed the principle of regeneration as the basis of value creation in the short, medium, and long term.\nOUR MATERIALITY PROCESS\nAt TTE, assessing materiality is an ongoing process, where we take a 360-degree view of our business to consider our operations and how they impact economic activity, the wellbeing of our people, business partners and the wider community as well as the environment. This involves \nexamining the environmental, socio-economic, and governance concerns in our operating environment and the corresponding risks and opportunities that impact our Company. Annually, we perform a comprehensive materiality assessment to guide strategical resource allocation for value creation. We review and update Material Matters based on stakeholder significance and changing operational environments, following Hayleys Group guidelines.\nLegislation and ESG related principle and \nframeworks\n(Refer Page 138 for Relevant Standard)Risk and Opportunity in Operating context \n(Refer Page 44 for operating context and page \n129 EROM report)\nIdentify long list of material maters\nMapping the company\u2019s value chain (Refer Page 23) Filtering of material maters through Stakeholder engagement context (Refer Pa ge 46)\nPrioritizing Critical and significant Material IssuesSectorial and industry trends\nImpact Assessment Materiality Assessment Financial Materiality\nConsideration for Strategy \nAlignmentConsideration for business \nmodel alignmentConsideration for TTE\u2019s Policy \nalignment", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2308, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54151b0c-1389-4c01-89d1-52ec289f0860": {"__data__": {"id_": "54151b0c-1389-4c01-89d1-52ec289f0860", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "60cfe729-0514-46ca-ab77-10608394d96b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "0f22d70ecc9ae38c692fe5959463b0e2ba5e76f754f71489382f8422cc9935bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "52\nTALAWAKELLE TEA ESTATES PLC\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL  REPORT 2022/23Overview\nManagement Discussion and Analysis\nRisk and Governance\nStatement of ESG Performance\nFinancial Reports\nAppendices\nMateriality Matrix\nRecent volatile events, including the \nspillover effects of the pandemic, the economic crisis, fuel and energy shortages and widespread policy uncertainty prompted deeper introspection into our Material Matters in the current financial year.

total revenue for FY 2022/23. On a revenue / profit basis, the tea operations declared exceptional results in the year under review. Main contributory factor for the extraordinary result was the high sales averages gained on the back of the Rupee devaluation. TTE\u2019s superior product quality meant the gains were substantially greater and ended up achieving a higher price difference above the National average.\nYields dropped YOY as a result of the \nGovernments decision to ban the use of fertilizer and agro chemicals. Fertilizer applications were severely disrupted for a good 18 months from the time the ban was in effect from mid-2020. However, the ban was revoked in late 2021 but the ill effects continued in to 2022 / 23.\nOverall tea production was down to 5.1Mn \nkg compared to 5.9 Mn kg in the previous year. TTE\u2019s drop of 14% was on the back of a National reduction of 16%. Raw material supply from TTE estates for Tea production stood at 86% while the remainder was sourced from Smallholders.\nHighlights for 2022/23\n \u0a8a Overall Rank No.01 \u2013 for the 5th \nconsecutive year amongst RPCs\n \u0a8a Low Grown Rank No.01 \u2013 for the 18th \nconsecutive year amongst RPCs\n \u0a8a National GSA \u2013 Highest ever \ndifference over National GSA Rs. 102.78 - 01st RPC to achieve over \nRs.100/-\n \u0a8a High Grown \u2013 Highest ever difference \nover Elevation average Rs. 130.63\n \u0a8a Low Grown - Highest ever difference \nover Elevation average Rs. 197.41 - 01st RPC to breach Rs. 1,500/- \nbarrier with a GSA of Rs.1,537.28\n \u0a8a 211 Top Prices\n \u0a8a 21 All Time Records\nWith the industry as a whole experiencing \nrecord prices due to the rapid LKR \ndevaluation against the USD from \nMarch 2022 onwards, TTE\u2019s elevational \naverages hit record highs, establishing new benchmarks during the year. The \nCompany recorded a total of 211 top prices \nand unprecedented 21 all time records \nfor the year 2022, while TTE\u2019s Gross Sales \nAverage (GSA) rose to Rs. 1,336.88/kg from \nthe Rs. 713.38/kg recorded in the previous year denoting a massive Rs. 623.50/kg improvement, which was the highest GSA increase amongst all RPCs.

Average sales volumes at the Colombo Tea auctions declined visibly owing to the ill-advised fertilizer ban and subsequent restricted applications due to price escalations.\n Meanwhile cost of production increased substantially to Rs. 1,033.48/kg owing to inflationary conditions induced by the Rupee devaluation. (2021/22 \u2013 Rs. 649.06/kg) In particular, the cost of imported fertilizer escalated 20 folds compared to the previous year. The withdrawal of fertilizer subsidy by the government influenced the prices of fertilizer. Cost of packing materials, fuel, electricity, transport cost also increases by 2-4 folds. Bought leaf COP increased significantly to Rs.1,526.98 in 2022/23 by 110% (2021/22 \u2013 Rs. 725.56/kg) with the high sales averages as the formula is based on Elevational GSA.\nNonetheless, the buffer created by the strong improvement in the topline helped TTE to safeguard margins, despite cost pressures.

Growth in Europe & Central Asia (ECA) is forecast to grow by a modest 2.1% in 2023, while Growth in Middle East and North Africa is anticipated to decelerate from 5.7% last year to 3.5% in 2023 and to 2.7% in 2024.\nSource: Global Economic Prospects 2023  \n(World Bank)SRI LANKA\u2019S ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n \u0a8a The Sri Lankan economy is poised \nto recover gradually from the deep economic contraction witnessed in 2022 buoyed by the macroeconomic adjustment programme under the IMF-EFF arrangement.\n \u0a8a The Government is envisaged to \ncontinue its commitment towards fiscal consolidation and economic reform programme with the aim of achieving the medium term fiscal targets set out under the IMF-EFF supported programme.\n \u0a8a Global headwinds, stemming from \nbroad-based slowdown in global economic growth in 2023 will have an adverse impact on the purposes of the Sri Lankan economy.\n \u0a8a Inflation is expected to stabilise at the \ntargeted levels over the medium term, supported by subdued aggregate demand, tight monetary and fiscal policies and abating supply disruptions both globally and domestically.\n \u0a8a With monetary policy focused on \nensuring price stability over the medium term, interest rates are expected to see a gradual decline.\n \u0a8a LKR is also expected to reach greater \nstability by mid-2023.\nSource: CBSL AR 2022\nTEA INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n \u0a8a After experiencing a worldwide decline \nin 2022, global tea production is expected to increase in 2023.\n \u0a8a Sri Lanka tea production could be \naffected by rising input costs that could potentially dampen average yields.\n \u0a8a The recent reduction in freight costs \nare likely to favour importers of \u2018Ceylon Tea\u2019, tendency of a strengthening of the Sri Lankan Rupee could result in lower Colombo Auction prices. \u0a8a Demand for tea is expected to vary \nbetween regions stemming from Russia-Ukraine war, slow recovery in Syria and Turkey following the devastating earthquakes and the volatility in the Middle East. European Union is expected to tighten the MRL\u2019s on use of Chemicals in agriculture by early 2024, which could result in weakened demand.\nWAY FORWARD FOR TTE\nTTE will look to scale up operations with a \nview to improving tea production volumes. \nTowards this end, we expect to significantly expand the non-wage model across all our estates, while working in parallel to improve our own yield ratios. Similarly, we will continue to work with our bought leaf suppliers as well. As always, quality will remain a top priority as we aim to retain our position as Industry leaders. TTE has achieved the highest National Average for an RPC in the last five years, consolidating its position.\nAs a long term de-risking measure, TTE is \nsystematically increasing our investment in crop diversification, focusing mainly on less labour intensive crops such as coconut, cinnamon and coffee.

averages recorded at the Colombo Tea Auctions, the Company reported solid Revenue growth in the current financial year. TTE\u2019s premium quality teas both in the high grown and low grown elevations continued to command premium prices at the Colombo Tea Auctions, often as much as 12% and 15% respectively, over the National Sales Average for these elevations. These record high prices helped to offset the impact of crop losses attributed to the spillover effect of the fertilizer ban and allowed the Company to record Rs. 7.9 Bn in tea Revenue for FY 2022/23, a massive 76% increase from Rs. 4.494 Bn reported in the previous year.\nIn contrast Revenue attributed to \nRubber declined on the back of weak global demand.

Any major PPE upgrades or improvements to estates and factories are planned ahead taking into account the Company\u2019s future business plans and estate-wise operational requirements. All new investments in PPE are undertaken in line with the Board approved annual CAPEX plan and budget.Materiality\nIn the realm of Manufacturing capital, two material themes of operating context dynamics and an agile business model hold signi ficance. This \nsection explores the management and performance of these matters, emphasizing their importance and impact on our ReGen Agenda a nd \nstrategic imperatives.\nThese measures are complemented by \na comprehensive approach for the day to day management of field and factory operations, where our portfolio of global standards and certifications, such as RA \u2122 , HACCP, ISO 22000:2018, ISO 14001:2015, ISO 50001:2018, ISO 14064-1:2018 ,ISO 9001:2015,Ecolable-Tea and Great Place to Work all contribute towards safeguarding the integrity and operational efficacy of our estates and factories in the long term.As per our classification, we consider the \n7 estates located in Talawakelle and the 5 in Nanu Oya to be in the high grown tea region, while the 3 estates in Deniyaya and 1 in Galle fall into the low grown tea region. The high grown region accounts for approximately 83% of TTE\u2019s total tea cultivation extent. On several of our low grown estates, we have cultivated other crops on a limited scale. These include Timber/Fuelwood and Cinnamon and more recently Coconut.

The solution involved installation of a 300 meter zip line across the Agra Oya that runs through Bearwell estate. The zip line was installed at a higher elevation across the water and  connected directly to the loft of the Bearwell factory. Using only gravitational force, a sack of green leaf once tied to a karabiner, attached to a pulley mounted on the cable will travel down along the zip line into the factory. This mechanism which has been in use since June 2022 and has proven to be faster, environmental friendly and less labour intensive process with minimal damage to green leaf.\nMaintenance of Factory Infrastructure\nWe have implemented strict schedules to ensure all machinery and equipment at factories are maintained in line with manufacturers\u2019 specifications thus maximizing functional efficiency at all times. A team of trained technicians have been appointed at each factory to oversee these processes.

Regular \nand consistent engagement ensures \nsmooth information flow, encourages \ncollaboration, and enables prompt \nresolution of any concerns or challenges. \nThis approach builds trust, nurtures \npartnerships, and ensures a sustainable \nsupply chain.\nIn addition to buyer and supplier \nrelationships, TTE actively engages with \nlocal communities.

Our network of tea brokers are the main facilitators in promoting our black tea at the Colombo tea auctions and Green teas through private treaty. Tea sold at the Colombo tea auctions via TTE\u2019s network of 5 brokers accounted for approximately 96% of the Company\u2019s annual sales volumes for FY 2022/23.\nExporters and \nLocal BuyersOverseas Buyers Sold through Brokers at Colombo Tea \nAuctions, Private Sales, Direct Sales & \nExportsProducts Produced by TTE\nSOCIAL AND RELATIONSHIP CAPITAL\nMANAGEMENT APPROACH\nGRI 3-3\nOur approach to develop and retain a loyal \ncustomer base is driven by a 360\u00b0 value proposition that aims to ensure 100% satisfaction across every aspect of the journey.\nPRODUCT STEWARDSHIP\nGRI 416-1, 2-23, 2-24\nProduct stewardship marks the point of origin of TTE\u2019s customer value proposition. We articulate our commitment to product stewardship via our \u201cQuality and Food Safety Policy\u201d, which is framed around three key principles - Zero tolerance of non-compliance, implementation of agricultural best practices and voluntary adoption of global manufacturing standards.\nBeing the overarching constitutional \nframework for end-to-end quality and safety assurance, the Quality and Food Safety Policy sets out detailed guidelines to preserve the quality and safety efficacy of the product value chain from cultivation, fertiliser application, harvesting, weighing, drying, withering, sifting, grading and all the way up to packing and dispatch. Whilst 100% of our products assessed for health and safety impact.\nMeanwhile, for more stringent control \nover selected areas of our operation we have established specific guidelines such as the MRL Assurance Process for Agro \nChemical Inputs and the MRL Assurance \nProcess of Tea. A key highlight of these \nmandates is the independent verification of product safety standards based on random sampling.\nPACKAGING AND LABELLING\nGRI 417-1\nGiven that our tea is packed in paper sacks for the purpose of export, labelling information is printed on each individual sack. We adhere to all product labelling guidelines established by The Sri Lanka Tea Board and Colombo Tea Traders Association.

We \nhave ethical recruitment policies in place. \nAll our workforce in the supply chain our \nwithin appropriate institutional and legal \nframeworks.Our efforts to create the best in-class EVP \nis underpinned by the uncompromising \ncommitment to regulatory compliance. \nTwo key pieces of legislation apply to \nTTE\u2019s employees - the estate workforce \nfalls under the purview of the Wages Board \nOrdinance, while the executive employees \nare covered under the Shop and Office \nact 19 of 1954 and amendments thereto.  \nApart from this the EPF Act, ETF Act and \nthe Payment of Gratuity Act of Sri Lanka \nalso apply to the Company\u2019s operations. As \na responsible employer, TTE complies in \nfull with all relevant conditions stipulated \nunder the aforementioned labour laws. There were no incidents of non-compliance \nreported in the current financial year.   HR Governance \nTTE maintains a top-down approach to HR \nGovernance. Accordingly, all major decisions are subject to the approval of the GMC \nMember. Under the stewardship of the GMC \nMember, clear reporting lines have been \nestablished to facilitate supervisory oversight \nfor HR matters at regional and estate level. \nThis oversight structure is complemented \nby the Hayleys Group (Plantation Sector) \nHR Policy Framework which provides the \nfoundation for managing the interests of our \n4,825 strong team of employees.

In contrast to the traditional attendance-based earnings, the non-wage model is designed to empower workers to become entrepreneurs and earn a living on their own terms.\nTo facilitate the non-wage model, TTE allocates a designated block of land from each estate to allow individual workers (Block Manager) to cultivate green tea. Block Managers have the freedom to mobilise their family members to get involved in harvesting of green leaf, thus greatly improving productivity. The arrangement is supported through a guaranteed buyback arrangement whereby Block Managers can sell harvested green leaf to the Company, in turn becoming part of TTE\u2019s bought leaf supplier base.In FY 2022/23, the non-wage model \nwas fully rolled out across all TTE estates. This was accompanied with a massive awareness building campaign to emphasise the benefits of entrepreneurship. Testifying to the success of these efforts, a total of 435 new Block Managers were on-boarded during the year. As at the end March 2023, all estates together had a base of 1,804 Block Managers. The overall gender distribution among block Managers stands at 2:1 (male: female) and the earning capacity of Block Managers is largely based on productivity. \nPERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT\nGRI 404-3\nThe emphasis on promulgating the performance-driven culture has led TTE to establish formal mechanisms to measure and manage employee performance at all levels of operation. Consequently, the performance of TTE employees is assessed at least once a year, if not more often depending on the employee category. All employees were evaluated through the performance monitoring system during  the year.\nThe performance of the estate workforce \nis based on the \u2018Colour Card System\u2019, where employee performance is evaluated based on the daily minimum expected quantity of plucked green leaf.

Accordingly, estate workers can directly reach out to their respective management to escalate any issues. The monthly labour day is another opportunity for workers to meet with estate management to discuss concerns. TTE\u2019s estate management teams are trained regularly on the proper implementation of the RA remedial protocol.

The factory processing stage accounts for a majority of the renewable materials used by the company. Given that the company\u2019s core products are exported, TTE has limited opportunities to reclaim and reuse packaging materials. There for zero percent recycled Materials used TTE faces constraints in incorporating recycled raw materials into its production processes.

This innovative approach aimed to improve soil health, increase fertilizer efficiency, and serve as a carbon sequestration agent. Biochar, a byproduct of TTE\u2019s biomass energy generation, was used as a renewable material with zero emissions.\nThe project focused on producing Biochar without additional energy inputs, utilizing \nits slow-release properties to enhance long-term fertilizer efficiency in tea fields. By reducing the volume of applied fertilizer, the project aimed to improve soil health over time. Additionally, Biochar\u2019s ability to absorb atmospheric CO\n2 further contributed to its \nrole as a carbon sink.\nThis pilot project demonstrated TTE\u2019s commitment to sustainable practices and its \npursuit of environmentally friendly nature based solutions under our ReGen Agenda. By exploring Zero Energy Biochar, TTE aimed to optimize resource utilization, reduce environmental impact, and enhance overall sustainability in their operations.\nRenewable and Non-renewable Materials \n- 2022/23\n88% 12%\n Renewable materials \n Non-renewable materials\nEfficient use of natural resources, Soil health \nmanagement plan and IPM Practices, minimum waste process, the generated recycled back for productive use", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3443, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37366a07-8a6e-4094-8821-10612eca0829": {"__data__": {"id_": "37366a07-8a6e-4094-8821-10612eca0829", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75c6f6fe-b139-4435-ad80-e7215d714ae0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "b57b341b1f9f5c65629d7c60eac9c0c5bc1bb64d1c7fb32ad31cbdca91a8d6ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "121\nTALAWAKELLE TEA ESTATES PLC\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL  REPORT 2022/23Overview\nManagement Discussion and Analysis\nRisk and Governance\nStatement of ESG Performance\nFinancial Reports\nAppendices\nof compaction areas, soil moisture level, \ndrainage conditions, and identification of areas with visible nutrient deficiencies. Based on these assessments, we identify soil management measures to build up soil organic matter, increase on-estate nutrient recycling, and optimize soil moisture.\nWe regularly conduct soil tests, including \nmacronutrients and organic matter, for representative samples of our estates.\nOur organic soil enrichment program \ninvolves applying compost through boreholes drilled into the soil around the tea bushes and adding bulk manure, along with slow release techniques for long-term soil health. We have also implemented a comprehensive 4R Nutrient Stewardship Framework to optimize when and where nutrients are available and minimize environmental contamination. To protect the soil of our estates, we plant cover crops to prevent soil exposure.\nAgrochemical Use\nTTE places a high reliance on natural solutions and a low reliance on chemical pesticides for pest management. As such, we adhere to the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) method, an ecosystem-based approach to crop production and protection. The three primary principles of IPM are prevention, pest monitoring, and intervention, with non-chemical measures as the first line of defense, as defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). We believe that a healthy crop is less susceptible to disease and insect infestation. Therefore, we implement preventive measures such as good agricultural practices, conserve and enhance biodiversity through natural vegetation that can harbor natural enemies, and maintain soil health.\nAll agrochemicals used by TTE are \nlegally registered in the country and purchased from authorized vendors in original and sealed packaging and under Targeting \u201cChemical-free Fields\u201d\n5% Reduction of total agro-chemicals usage by following IPM Strategies\nrecommended guidelines of Tea Research and Rubber Research Institute, Sri Lanka.

It is also hoped that \nhaving greater control over the fuelwood cultivation process will minimise supply chain disruptions and also achieve our quality assurance objectives. In the current financial year, we allocated a collective total of 641 hectares across our estates for planting of fuelwood.\nMeanwhile, seeing how excessive rainfall \nwas adversely affecting the fuelwood intensity, we have implemented preheating systems to dry the fuelwood until it reaches the optimum moisture level, resulting in a more efficient boiler operation and reduced consumption of fuelwood.\nOur dedicated Energy Management Policy \ntogether with our ISO 50001:2018 certified Energy Management System create a framework to promote responsible energy consumption and improve energy intensity across all operations.\nIn keeping with its energy self-sufficiency \ngoal, TTE has in recent years further accelerated its investments into renewable energy by commissioning rooftop solar infrastructure at factories and mini hydro systems in selected estates located in hydro catchment areas. As part of the ongoing improvements to these systems, a pilot project was initiated in mid-2022 to investigate the possibility of upgrading mini hydro infrastructure with the use of the latest \u201cTurbulent\u201d technology for efficient micro hydropower plants to minimise damage to freshwater ecosystems resulting from the water extraction process.

The briquettes used as biomass fuel are produced from recycled agricultural waste and accounts for 3.5% of our fuel usage for processing tea. Biodegradable waste generated by estate communities are composted and added to tea fields and home garden plots.\nThe very small amount of non-degradable and hazardous waste is collected and store according to guidelines at our estates and factories and later through Independent Disposer. Of these, used agrochemical containers are sent back to the original suppliers for repacking, while e-waste is disposed of through CEA approved waste disposal partners.\nWaste type and Disposal Method 2022 /23 2021 /22 \nWaste diverted from disposal\nComposting (kilogram)\nBiodegradable mix waste  125,204  221,385 \nRecycling   \nGlass  492  468 \nPlastic  1,314  1,104 \nPolythene  1,704  1,193 \nMetal/Iron  616  681 \nPaper  1,404  2,593 \nTotal Recycling  5,530  6,039 \nE-waste  439  334 \nBulbs-used  649  495 \nTotal on-site Storage  1,088  829 \nWaste directed to disposal\nAuthorised Landfill\nNon-hazardous mix waste  3,412  5,936 25   PET collection points\n100  Kilos of plastic bottles \ncollected monthly\n1,000  Kilos of plastic is ready \nto recycle\nTaking a major step in advancing its waste recycling efforts, TTE invested in its own recycling plant for compacting used PET bottles.\nAs part of its Solid Waste Management programme, TTE strictly prohibits the creation of unauthorised landfill sites and open burning of waste on its estates.

managing these risks and opportunities effectively in order to fulfil its strategic ambitions. TTE\u2019s Approach to Risk & \nOpportunity Management\nTTE\u2019s Risk Management Approach goes \nhand in hand with the development and \nexecution of the Company\u2019s strategy. We \nbelieve that doing so paves the way for \npreemptive risk mitigation measures that \nwill complement our business objectives \nand increase our corporate value. \nFurthermore, by disclosing appropriate risk \ninformation to the public, we aim to earn \nthe trust and respect of our stakeholders \nand strengthen our reputation as a well-\nmanaged corporate entity.Our Risk & Opportunity \nManagement Framework\nTTE has implemented an enterprise-wide Risk \nManagement Framework which sets out how \nrisk management principles are embedded \nacross business operations and integrated \ninto decision-making processes at all levels. \nAccording to ISO 31000, the framework \noutlines the relevant components that enable \nTTE to design, implement, monitor, review and \ncontinually improve risk management across \nthe organization. The framework is supported \nby the Risk Register that documents all \ncurrent risks applicable to the Company along \nwith the relevant risk mitigation and control \nframeworks relating to each category. \nEffective risk management based on sound \nrisk management fundamentals safeguards \nTTE\u2019s competitive position and supports \nsustainable long term growth\nRisk & Opportunity Management Report \nStructure\n  Page No\nTTE\u2019s Approach to Risk Management and Our Risk and Opportunity Management129\nManagement Framework 129\nRisk & Opportunity \nGovernance Structure129\nRisk & Opportunity \nUniverse130\nRisk & Opportunity \nManagement Process130\nManaging our Risk & \nOpportunity Strategically131\nRealizing Our \nOpportunities Strategically135\nKey Risk Predicted in 2023 \nAnd Beyond136\nBusiness Units/ Estate Level \nManagement Primary risk and control Responsibility\n \u0a8a Promoting the risk awareness \nculture\n \u0a8a Complies with risk appetite\n \u0a8a Owner of risk management \nprocesses\n \u0a8a Responsible for day-to-day \nrisk management in line with Board approved risk management framework \n \u0a8a Identification of emerging risks \nand escalation to MD/ CMC1st line of Defence\nMD + ESEG Steering Committee Chaired by CEO Oversight\n \u0a8a Develops policies and \nstandards\n \u0a8a Develops risk \nmanagement processes and controls\n \u0a8a Assign risk duties and \nresponsibilities\n \u0a8a Review, assess, \npreview and report to the Board2nd line of Defence\nAudit Committee - Assisted by the Hayleys Group Internal Audit Division and Independent Assurance given by Internal/ External Auditors\n \u0a8a Provide independent \nand objective assurance regarding the efficacy of the risk management framework\n \u0a8a External Audit provides \nassurance on TTE\u2019s financial and ESG statements3rd line of DefenceHayleys PLC Board & Risk Management Committee\nTTE Board & Risk Management CommitteeRISK & OPPORTUNITY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3262, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85f46eba-7905-4e0b-ad68-99a3b2f5409e": {"__data__": {"id_": "85f46eba-7905-4e0b-ad68-99a3b2f5409e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0207cc20-615b-4144-9bbf-f1d13e852f7d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "b3525e963300e011a5ddd567010ad0c0a65b42d89603d3f0ac27ad0b012df01a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "130\nTALAWAKELLE TEA ESTATES PLC\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL  REPORT 2022/23Overview\nManagement Discussion and Analysis\nRisk and Governance\nStatement of ESG Performance\nFinancial Reports\nAppendices\nRISK & OPPORTUNITY UNIVERSE\nOur risk universe represents the risks \nthat are central to our business. In an increasingly challenging business landscape, we constantly monitor, manage and mitigate both current and emerging risks in order to achieve our business objectives. Our Top 10 risks and the risk mitigating strategies adopted are outlined below.\nRISK & OPPORTUNITY MANAGEMENT PROCESS\nTTE\u2019s Risk Management Process comprises 4 distinct yet interconnected steps - Risk Identification, Risk Assessment, Risk Mitiga tion, and \nRisk Monitoring which together create the ecosystem to safeguard the Company against actual and potential risks.\nRisk \nAssessment\nRisk \nMonitoringRisk \nIdentification\nRisk  \nMitigationRisks are identified as part of the Context of the Organization exercise and recorded in the Risk \nRegister. \n ISO 31010 Risk Assessment Standards provides guidance on the selection of the appropriate risk evaluation tools. The most common tools used include FMEA (failure mode effects analysis), \nSWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity and threat) etc. \nTTE\u2019s Risk Control activities are framed around the final risk factor rating. Accordingly, Risks with a factor less than the risk threshold set in the Risk Register may be accepted without a \nmitigation plan, unless otherwise directed by management. However, for risks with a final Risk \nFactor rating equal to or greater than the threshold set in the Risk Register, the management \nwill decide either to completely reject, or accept the risks subject to the development of a \nsuitable risk mitigation plan. Mitigation plans are documented in the Risk Register.\nRisk monitoring is conducted on a continuous and ongoing through the three line of defence \nmechanism. The 1st line of defence carries out risk monitoring at an operational level, while \nthe second line of defence is involved in more high level monitoring to determine adherence \nto established risk frameworks. In their capacity as independent observers, the 3rd line of \ndeference monitors the efficacy of the Company\u2019s overall risk management framework.Four Stages \nin Risk \nManagement \nProcessRisk &

Further, the valuation and the changes in underlying significant assumptions are highly sensitive in assessing the value of retirement benefit obligation.\n \u0a8a The determination of the base salary/wage rate and the future \nsalary/wage growth rates are sensitive for the purpose of measuring retirement benefit obligation as of year-end.\nKey areas of significant judgements, estimates and assumptions are \ndisclosed in note 23 to the financial statements.Our audit procedures included the following:\n \u0a8a We assessed the competency, capability and objectivity of the \nexternal actuary engaged by the Group.\n \u0a8a We read the external actuary\u2019s report and understood the key \nestimates made and the approach taken by the actuary in determining the present value of retirement benefit obligation.\n \u0a8a  We assessed reasonableness the discount rate used, with our \ninternally developed benchmarks.\n \u0a8a We validated the key data used by the actuary to the underlying \ndata held by the Group.\nWe have also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made \nin Notes 23 to the financial statements relating to the significant judgements and estimates.\nMeasurement of Bearer Biological Assets\nThe Bearer Biological Asset is a significant non-current asset of the Group representing 21% of the total assets comprising of Rs. 1,500 Mn as Mature plantations and Rs 398Mn as Immature Plantations as at 31 March 2023, as disclosed in Notes 13.B to the financial statements.\nMeasurement of Bearer Biological assets in the financial statements \nwas a key audit matter due to following :\n \u0a8a Materiality of the balance and its significance to total assets \n(21%) of the group.\n \u0a8a Identification of costs to be capitalised as immature plantations, \ninvolvement of management judgement regarding the point at which transfers are to be made from immature plantations to mature plantations and for the identification of triggers of impairment.Our audit procedures included the following: \n \u0a8a Assessed the processes and controls in place to ensure proper \nidentification of the expenses incurred relating to immature plantations.\n \u0a8a Validated the significant amounts capitalised (including \ncapitalized labour and other acceptable costs) by examining related invoices, capital expenditure authorizations and other corroborative evidences.\n \u0a8a Assessed timely transfer of matured plants to respective \nmatured plantation categories by examining the ageing profile of immature plantations.\n \u0a8a  Inspected the ageing profile of the immature biological assets \nas of the reporting date to ensure that triggers of impairment have been identified on a timely basis, assessed for probable impairment charges/losses and duly accounted for in the financial statements.\nWe also assessed the adequacy of the related disclosures given in \nNotes 3.7.7.1 and 13B in the financial statements.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3783, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4fe70ea0-7f61-41ec-9b2d-f0eb13eb78ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "4fe70ea0-7f61-41ec-9b2d-f0eb13eb78ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f948ce0f-3f32-4dc5-a94d-6f383634fd87", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "232750f233734656607bfe871b142243b4d62dcb4e5f35c6d1b21a1071d145cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "178178\nTALAWAKELLE TEA ESTATES PLCTALAWAKELLE TEA ESTATES PLC\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL  REPORT 2022/23 INTEGRATED ANNUAL  REPORT 2022/23Overview\nManagement Discussion and Analysis\nRisk and Governance\nStatement of ESG Performance\nFinancial ReportsFinancial Reports\nAppendices\nOther information included in The \nCompany\u2019s 2023 Annual Report\nOther information consists of the \ninformation included in the Annual Report, other than the financial statements and our auditor\u2019s report thereon. Management is responsible for the other information.\nOur opinion on the financial statements \ndoes not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the financial \nstatements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\nResponsibilities of management and \nthose charged with governance\nManagement is responsible for the \npreparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.In preparing the financial statements, \nmanagement is responsible for assessing the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\nThose charged with governance are \nresponsible for overseeing the Company\u2019s and the Group\u2019s financial reporting process.\nAuditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit \nof the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable \nassurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SLAuSs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with \nSLAuSs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

Items of a dissimilar nature or function are presented separately unless they are immaterial.\n \n3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT \nACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe accounting policies set out below are \nconsistent with those used in the previous year. Accounting policies of subsidiaries are consistent with the policies adopted by the Group.\n3.1 Going Concern\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the assumption that The Company is a going concern. The Directors have made an assessment of the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, board is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group\u2019s ability to continue as going concern and they do not intend either to liquidate or to cease operations of Group. Therefore, the Consolidated Financial Statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.\nIn determining the basis of preparing the \nfinancial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023, based on available information, the management has assessed the prevailing macroeconomic conditions and its effect on the Group and the appropriateness of the use of the going concern basis. It is the view of the management that there are no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue to operate as a going concern. A Fast recovery momentum was observed as the Group reached pre COVID-19 levels of operations post the easing of restrictions. The management has formed judgment that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence \nfor the foreseeable future driven by the continuous operationalization of risk mitigation initiatives and monitoring of business continuity and response plans at each business unit level along with the financial strength of the Group.\nIn determining the above significant \nmanagement judgements, estimates and assumptions, the impact of the macroeconomic uncertainties, including supply chain disruptions, power interruptions and distribution challenges on account of the prevailing foreign exchange market limitations.\n3.2 Basis of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the Financial Statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 31st March 2023. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:\n \u0a8a Power over the investee (i.e., existing \nrights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee)\n \u0a8a Exposure, or rights, to variable returns \nfrom its involvement with the investee\n \u0a8a The ability to use its power over the \ninvestee to affect its returns\nGenerally, there is a presumption that a \nmajority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: \u0a8a The contractual arrangement with the \nother vote holders of the investee\n \u0a8a Rights arising from other contractual \narrangements\n \u0a8a The Group\u2019s voting rights and potential \nvoting rights\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary.

The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any Non-Controlling Interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether it measures the Non-Controlling Interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree\u2019s identifiable net assets. Acquisition - related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses.\nWhen the Group acquires a business, it \nassesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.\nIf the business combination is achieved in \nstages, any previously held equity interest is remeasured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost, \nbeing the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, \nthen the gain is recognised in profit or loss.\nAfter initial recognition, goodwill is \nmeasured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group\u2019s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.\nWhere goodwill has been allocated to \na cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.\n3.3 Current Versus non-current \nClassification\nThe Group presents assets and liabilities \nin statement of financial position based on current/ non-current classification. An asset as current when it is:\n \u0a8a Expected to be realised or intended \nto be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle\n \u0a8a Held primarily for the purpose of \ntrading\n \u0a8a Expected to be realised within twelve \nmonths after the reporting period.\nOr\n \u0a8a Cash or cash equivalent unless \nrestricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least \ntwelve months after the reporting \nperiod.All other assets are classified as non-\ncurrent.\nA liability is current when:\n \u0a8a It is expected to be settled in normal \noperating cycle\n \u0a8a It is held primarily for the purpose of \ntrading\n \u0a8a It is due to be settled within twelve \nmonths after the reporting period.\nOr\n \u0a8a It does not have a right at the reporting \ndate to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.\nThe Group classifies all other liabilities as \nnon-current.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are \nclassified as non-current assets and liabilities.\n3.4 Fair Value Measurement\nThe Group measures financial instruments and non-financial assets at fair value at each statement of financial position date. Fair value related disclosures for financial instruments and non-financial assets that are measured at fair value or where fair values are disclosed are summarized in the following notes:\n \u0a8a Managed Consumable Biological \nAssets Note 13C\n \u0a8a Produce Growing on Bearer Biological \nAssets Note 15\nFair value is the price that would be \nreceived to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4936, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e302d54-455a-40eb-9298-ae0c3ce66c32": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e302d54-455a-40eb-9298-ae0c3ce66c32", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "191", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fcec3ac1-b477-4d54-a216-763eb4468664", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "191", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "df856a84f90fcf9260641e21549515888105b98ced761f8b1246a6bf6e3f74d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1cb0bc98-a46a-458e-9beb-cb24c9c33aaa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c1234e3d82daf1191ea3904f0dc34bed55520752d07f836f0d4b242297e13c07", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "189189\nTALAWAKELLE TEA ESTATES PLCTALAWAKELLE TEA ESTATES PLC\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL  REPORT 2022/23 INTEGRATED ANNUAL  REPORT 2022/23Overview\nManagement Discussion and Analysis\nRisk and Governance\nStatement of ESG Performance\nFinancial ReportsFinancial Reports\nAppendices\n \u0a8a In the principal market for the asset or \nliability; or,\n \u0a8a In the absence of a principal market, in \nthe most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\nThe principal or the most advantageous \nmarket must be accessible by the Group.\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is \nmeasured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\nA fair value measurement of a non-\nfinancial asset takes into account a market participant\u2019s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\nThe Group uses valuation techniques that \nare appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value \nis measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n \u0a8a Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market \nprices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n \u0a8a Level 2 - Valuation techniques \nfor which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable\n \u0a8a Level 3 - Valuation techniques \nfor which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservableFor assets and liabilities that are \nrecognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.\nExternal valuers are involved for valuation \nof significant assets, such as managed biological assets. Involvement of external valuers is decided upon annually by the Management Committee after discussion with and approval by the Company\u2019s Audit Committee. Selection criteria include market knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained. The Management Committee decides, after discussions with the Group\u2019s external valuers, which valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case.\nFor the purpose of fair value disclosures, \nthe Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.\n3.5 Foreign Currencies\nThe Group\u2019s consolidated financial \nstatements are presented in Sri Lankan \nRupees, which is also the parent company\u2019s functional currency.

These are recognised in OCI until the net investment is disposed of, at which time, the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items are also recorded in OCI.\nNon-monetary items that are measured in \nterms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).\n3.6 Cash Dividend and non-cash \nDistribution to Equity Holders of the Parent\nThe Company recognizes a liability to \nmake cash or non-cash distributions \nto equity holders of the parent when the distribution is authorized and the \ndistribution is no longer at the discretion of \nthe Company.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5159, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1cb0bc98-a46a-458e-9beb-cb24c9c33aaa": {"__data__": {"id_": "1cb0bc98-a46a-458e-9beb-cb24c9c33aaa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "191", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fcec3ac1-b477-4d54-a216-763eb4468664", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "191", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "df856a84f90fcf9260641e21549515888105b98ced761f8b1246a6bf6e3f74d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5e302d54-455a-40eb-9298-ae0c3ce66c32", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "191", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "70cd93a654130608e48a06bb1a4ee5eec56ad116bb3f1eb22bf995d7b969609a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Non-monetary items that are measured in \nterms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.

The \ncapitalisation will cease when the crops are \nready for commercial harvest.\n3.7. 3 Owned Assets\nThe cost of Property, Plant & Equipment includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Such costs includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long term construction projects if the recognition criteria are met. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other cost directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located.\nPurchased software that is integral to the \nfunctionality of the related equipment is capitalized as a part of that equipment.\nWhen significant parts of property, \nplant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the entity recognises such parts as individual assets (major components) with specific useful lives and depreciation, respectively. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the statements of profit or loss as incurred. The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of the asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met.\nCapital work-in-progress is transferred to \nthe respective asset accounts at the time of first utilization or at the time the asset is commissioned.\n3.7.4 Leases\nThe Group assesses at the contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract \nconveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nGroup as a Lessee\nThe Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short term leases and leases of low-value assets.

When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Group\u2019s continuing involvement in the asset. In that case, the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.\nContinuing involvement that takes the form \nof a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.\n3.8.1.4 Impairment of Financial Assets\nThe Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value \nthrough profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.\nECLs are recognised in two stages. For \ncredit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).\n3.8.2 Financial Liabilities\n3.8.2.1 Initial Recognition and \nMeasurement\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial \nrecognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.\nAll financial liabilities are recognized \ninitially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.\nThe Group\u2019s financial liabilities include \ntrade and other payables, bank overdrafts and loans and borrowings.3.8.2.2 Subsequent Measurement\nThe subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as described below:\n(a) Financial Liabilities at Fair Value \nThrough Profit or Loss\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through \nprofit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.\nFinancial liabilities are classified as held for \ntrading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term.\nGains or losses on liabilities held for trading \nare recognized in the statement of profit or loss.\n(b) Financial Liabilities at Amortized \nCost\nAfter initial recognition, interest bearing \nloans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.

Change in the fair value of such agricultural produce recognized in profit or loss at the end of each reporting period.\nFor this purpose, quantities of harvestable \nagricultural produce ascertained based on harvesting cycle of each crop category by limiting to one harvesting cycle based on last day of the harvest in the immediately preceding cycle. Further 50% of the crop in that harvesting cycle considered for the valuation.\nFor the valuation of the harvestable \nagricultural produce, the company uses the following price formulas.\n \u0a8a Tea \u2013 Bought Leaf rate (current month) \nless cost of harvesting & transport\n \u0a8a Rubber \u2013 latex Price (95% of current \nRSS1 Price) less cost of tapping & transport3.10 Inventories\nFinished Goods Manufactured from Agricultural Produce of Biological Assets.\nThese are valued at the lower of cost \nand estimated net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price at which stocks can be sold in the ordinary course of business after allowing for cost of realisation and/or cost of conversion from their existing state to saleable condition.\nInput Material, Spares and ConsumablesAt actual cost on weighted average basis.Agricultural produce harvested from \nbiological assets\nAgricultural produce harvested from \nbiological asset are measured at their fair value less cost to sell at the point of harvest. The finished and semi-finished inventories from agricultural produce are valued by adding the cost of conversion to the fair value of the agricultural produce.\n3.11 Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form an integral part of the Group\u2019s cash management and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Statements of Cash Flow.\n3.12 Impairment of Non-Financial \nAssets\nThe Group assesses, at each reporting \ndate, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset\u2019s recoverable amount. An asset\u2019s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset\u2019s or cash-generating unit\u2019s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its \nvalue in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated \nfuture cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.

If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset\u2019s or CGU\u2019s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset\u2019s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment \nannually as at 31st March 2023 and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.\nImpairment is determined for goodwill \nby assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU (or group of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful \nlives are tested for impairment annually as at 31st March at the CGU level, as appropriate, and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.\n3.13 Provisions\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits \nwill be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the statement of profit or loss net of any reimbursement.\n3.14 Employees Benefits\n(a) Defined Contribution Plans - \nProvident Funds and Trust Fund\nA defined contribution plan is a post-\nemployment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to Provident and Trust Funds covering all employees are recognised as an expense in profit or loss in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.\nThe Company contributes 12% on \nconsolidated salary of the employees to Ceylon Planters\u2019 Provident Society (CPPS)/Estate Staff Provident Society (ESPS)/ Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF).\nAll the employees of the Company are \nmembers of the Employees\u2019 Trust Fund, to which the Company contributes 3% on the consolidated salary of such employees.\n(b) Defined Benefit Plan\nA defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The liability recognised in the Financial Statements in respect of defined benefit plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the Reporting date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash \nflows using the interest rates that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related liability. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised as in retained earnings through other comprehensive income. Past service costs are recognised immediately in statement of profit or loss.\nThe provision has been made for \nretirement gratuities from the first year of service for all employees, in conformity with LKAS 19, Employee Benefits.

When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income over the period necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate. Where the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as deferred income and released to income in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset.\nWhere the Group receives non-monetary \ngrants, the asset and the grant are recorded gross at nominal amounts and released to the Statement of profit or loss over the expected useful life and pattern of consumption of the benefit of the underlying asset by equal annual installments. Where loans or similar assistance are provided by governments or related institutions with an interest rate below the current applicable market rate, the effect of this favorable interest is regarded as additional government grant. Assets are amortised over their useful lives as follows.\nGrants related to Property, Plant & \nEquipment other than grants received for forestry are initially deferred and allocated to income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the related Property, Plant & Equipment as follows: Assets are amortised \nover their useful lives or unexpired lease period, whichever is less.\nBuildings 23.3 years (Over the \nremaining lease period)\nRoads 5 Years\nGrants received for forestry are initially \ndeferred and credited to income once when the related blocks of trees are harvested.\n3.19 Statements of Profit or Loss\nFor the purpose of presentation of statement of profit or loss, the function of expenses method is adopted, as it represents fairly the elements of the Group\u2019s performance.\n3.19.1 Revenue\nRevenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty. Under SLFRS 15, revenue is recognised upon satisfaction of performance obligation.\nThe Group is in the business of cultivation, \nmanufacture and sale of black tea, rubber and other crops (Plantation Produce). Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of the goods are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods. The Group has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements, because it typically controls the goods before transferring them to customer3.19.1.1 Revenue from Contracts with \nCustomers\n \u0a8a Sale of Plantation produce\nRevenue from sale of plantation produce is recognized at the point in time when the control of the goods are transferred to the customer. Black tea produce are sold at the Colombo Tea Auction and the highest bidder whose offer is accepted shall be the buyer, and a sale shall be completed at the fall of the hammer, at which point control is transferred to the customer. Revenue from sale of other crops are recognized at the point in time when the control of the goods has been transferred to the customer generally upon delivery of the goods to the location specified by the customer and the acceptance of the goods by the customer.\nThere is no element of financing present as \nthe Group\u2019s sale of plantation produce are either on cash terms (Immediate payment or advance payment not exceeding 30 days) or on credit terms ranging from 7 to 15 days.\nRendering of Services\nService income from Group comprised with sale of hydro energy to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).

Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are \nmeasured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5167, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89fc65f8-2ab5-491f-81cf-056992e90dcc": {"__data__": {"id_": "89fc65f8-2ab5-491f-81cf-056992e90dcc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "202", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7af5ca80-cb4f-4958-b7b6-65a796e6c7f7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "202", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "243d53ac026045609c094e0dc6a5a01cb1fa441b192ceb6e4a2e72aab361f598", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2a3c3a1e-26e3-482d-acb6-f62cc573aefd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6bf3b6a50ebaa1bd0259860bd219db4464aa470c67bf5a4e32323caca44a2115", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "200200\nTALAWAKELLE TEA ESTATES PLCTALAWAKELLE TEA ESTATES PLC\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL  REPORT 2022/23 INTEGRATED ANNUAL  REPORT 2022/23Overview\nManagement Discussion and Analysis\nRisk and Governance\nStatement of ESG Performance\nFinancial ReportsFinancial Reports\nAppendices\nDeferred tax relating to items recognised \noutside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in Other Comprehensive Income or directly in equity.\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax \nliabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.\nTax benefits acquired as part of a business \ncombination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date, are recognised subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances change. The adjustment is either treated as a reduction in goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the measurement period or recognised in profit or loss.\n3.20 Statement of Cash Flows\nThe Statement of Cash Flow has been prepared using the \u2018indirect method\u2019. Interest paid is classified as operating cash flows, while dividends paid and Government grants received are classified as financing and investing cash flows, for the purpose of presenting the Statement of Cash Flow.\n3.21 Segment Reporting\nSegmental information is provided for the different business segments of the Group. An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group\u2019s other components. Since the individual segments are located close to each other and operate in the same industrial environment, the need for geographical segmentation has no material impact.The activities of the segments are \ndescribed on Note 6.2 in the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nRevenue and expenses directly attributable \nto each segment are allocated to the respective segments. Revenue and expenses not directly attributable to a segment are allocated on the basis of their resource utilisation, wherever possible.\nAssets and liabilities directly attributable \nto each segment are allocated to the respective segments. Assets and liabilities, which are not directly attributable to a segment, are allocated on a reasonable basis wherever possible. Unallocated items comprise mainly interest bearing loans, borrowings, and expenses.\nSegment capital expenditure is the total \ncost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one accounting period.\nAll operating segments\u2019 operating results are reviewed regularly to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.\n4. USE OF ESTIMATES AND 4. USE OF ESTIMATES AND \nJUDGMENTSJUDGMENTS\nThe preparation of the Group\u2019s \nconsolidated financial statements requires \nmanagement to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect \nthe reported amounts of revenues, \nexpenses, assets and liabilities, and \nthe accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are \nreviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in \nthe period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period and any future periods affected.\nInformation about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements is included in the following notes:\n4.1 Taxation\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.\nAccording to The Inland Revenue \n(Amendment) Bill, to amend the Inland Revenue Act, No.45 of 2022, Agro Farming is exempt from income tax for a period of 5 years effective from 01 April 2019 and Agro processing is liable at 30%. Accordingly, where applicable, the Group has separated its income and expenses as Agro faming and Agro Processing and applied the respective tax rates. \n4.2 Deferred Tax\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5088, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a3c3a1e-26e3-482d-acb6-f62cc573aefd": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a3c3a1e-26e3-482d-acb6-f62cc573aefd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "202", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7af5ca80-cb4f-4958-b7b6-65a796e6c7f7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "202", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "243d53ac026045609c094e0dc6a5a01cb1fa441b192ceb6e4a2e72aab361f598", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "89fc65f8-2ab5-491f-81cf-056992e90dcc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "202", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "051373ce3819a6d2563174ad9316c36e1bfe76edea23f9f8a4f5e5273dced4ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.\nAccording to The Inland Revenue \n(Amendment) Bill, to amend the Inland Revenue Act, No.45 of 2022, Agro Farming is exempt from income tax for a period of 5 years effective from 01 April 2019 and Agro processing is liable at 30%.

An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate; future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting period.\nIn determining the appropriate discount \nrate, management considers the interest rates of Sri Lanka government bonds with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the defined benefit obligation.\nThe mortality rate is based on publicly \navailable mortality tables. Future salary increases are based on expected future inflation rate and expected future salary increase rates of the Company.\nFurther details about Retirement benefit \nobligations are provided in Note 23.\n4.4 IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty \nOver Income Tax Treatment\nThe Interpretation addresses the \naccounting for income taxes when tax treatments involve uncertainty that affects the application of LKAS 12 Income Taxes. The Company applies significant judgement in identifying uncertainties over income tax treatments. It assessed whether the Interpretation had an impact on its financial statements. The Company determined that it is probable that its tax treatments will be accepted by the taxation authorities.\n4.5 Fair Valuation of Consumable \nBiological Assets\nThe fair value of managed timber depends \non number of factors that are determined on a discounted method using various \nfinancial and nonfinancial assumptions. The growth of the trees is determined by various biological factors that are highly unpredictable. Any change to the assumptions will impact to the fair value of biological assets. Key assumptions and sensitivity analysis of the biological assets are given in the Note 13C.\n4.6 Bearer Biological Assets\nA mature plantation is an area of land developed with crops such as tea, rubber and other crops which has been brought into bearing ready for commercial harvesting. Hence, transfer of immature plantations to mature plantation fields happens at the point of commencement of commercial harvesting which depends on growth of plants, weather patterns and soil condition. Therefore, immature to mature transfer require significant management judgment in determining the point at which a plant is deemed ready for commercial harvesting. \n4.7 Leases - Estimating the \nIncremental Borrowing rate\nThe Group cannot readily determine the \ninterest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing rate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. The IBR therefore reflects what the Group \u2018would have to pay\u2019, which requires estimation when no observable rates are available or when they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease. The Group estimates the IBR using observable inputs (such as market interest rates) when available and is required to make certain entity-specific estimates (such as the company\u2019s stand-alone credit rating).5.

Also, they clarify how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates. The amended standard clarifies that the effects on an accounting estimate of a change in an input or a change in a measurement technique are changes in accounting estimates if they do not result from the correction of prior period errors\nThe amendments are effective for annual \nreporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. Earlier application is permitted.\n5.3 Amendments to LKAS 12 Taxation \n- Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction\nThe amendments clarify that where \npayments that settle a liability are deductible for tax purposes, it is a matter of judgement (having considered the applicable tax law) whether such deductions are attributable for tax purposes to the liability recognised in the financial statements (and interest expense) or to the related asset component (and interest expense). This judgement is important in determining whether any temporary differences exist on initial recognition of the asset and liability.Also, under the amendments, the initial \nrecognition exception does not apply to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES 35. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES\nThe Group\u2019s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and borrowings, trade and other payables. T he main \npurpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group\u2019s operations and to provide guarantees to support its operations . The Group has \nloan and other receivables, trade and other receivables, and cash and short-term deposits that arise directly from its operatio ns. Accordingly \nthe Group has exposure to namely Credit Risk, Liquidity Risk, Currency Risk and Market Risks from its use of financial instrume nts.\nThis note presents information about the Group\u2019s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group\u2019s objectives, policies and proc esses for \nmeasuring and managing risk.\n35.1 Financial Risk Management Framework\nThe Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the group\u2019s financial Risk Managem ent \nframework which includes developing and monitoring the Group\u2019s financial Risk Management policies.\nThe Group financial Risk Management policies are established to identify, quantify and analyze the financial risks faced by the  Group, to set \nappropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor financial risks and adherence to limits. Financial Risk Management policies  and systems \nare reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group\u2019s activities.\nThe TTE PLC Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group\u2019s financial Risk Management policies and  \nprocedures and reviews the adequacy of the financial Risk Management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.\n35.2 Credit Risk\nCredit Risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet it s contractual \nobligations, and arise principally from the Group\u2019s receivable from customers and from its financing activities including depos its with banks \nand financial institutions foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.\n35.2.1 Trade and Other Receivables\nThe Group\u2019s exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual characteristics of each customer. The Group\u2019s credit policy  is monitored \nat the Board level. The new customers are analysed individually for credit worthiness before Group\u2019s standard payment and deliv ery terms \nand conditions are offered. Group review includes external ratings, when available and in some cases, bank references, purchase s limit etc. \nwhich also subject to under review on quarterly basis. The past experience of the Management is considered when revisions are m ade to \nterms and conditions.\nTTE PLC has a minimal credit risk of its trade receivables as the repayment is guaranteed within seven days by the Tea and Rubb er auction \nsystems.\nThe Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other  receivables.\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables at the reporting date is Rs. 220.4 Mn (2022 \u2013 Rs.156.6 Mn).\n35.2.2 Investments\nCredit risks from invested balance with the financial institutions are managed by the Board of Directors. Investments of surplu s funds are \nmade only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to them. The limits are set to minimize the concentrat ion of risks \nand therefore mitigate financial loss through potential counterparty\u2019s failure.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4267, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4ea4fe9-180f-42a3-b74c-5bebfb16709e": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4ea4fe9-180f-42a3-b74c-5bebfb16709e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "235", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2a3a2f64-1bad-4172-a86e-ad392ca4f2bd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "235", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "1a4996fd145845ae0ee864e802160d852853813202e6ca70214aaf547f21d23f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "233233\nTALAWAKELLE TEA ESTATES PLCTALAWAKELLE TEA ESTATES PLC\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL  REPORT 2022/23 INTEGRATED ANNUAL  REPORT 2022/23Overview\nManagement Discussion and Analysis\nRisk and Governance\nStatement of ESG Performance\nFinancial ReportsFinancial Reports\nAppendices\nThe Group held short term investments of Rs. 3,513.6 Mn as at 31st March 2023 (2022 \u2013 Rs.1,901.8 Mn) which represents the maxim um \ncredit exposure on these assets.\n35.2.3 Cash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Group held cash at bank and in hand of Rs. 173.0 Mn as at 31st March 2023 (2022 \u2013 Rs. 29.5 Mn) which represents its maximum  credit \nexposure on these assets.\n \u0a8a Sampath Bank PLC \u2013 A (lka)\n \u0a8a Hatton National Bank PLC \u2013A (lka)\n \u0a8a Bank of Ceylon \u2013  A (lka)\n \u0a8a Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd \u2013 AA-(lka)\n \u0a8a Union Bank Colombo PLC \u2013 BBB- (lka)\n \u0a8a Seylan Bank PLC \u2013 A- (lka) \n \u0a8a DFCC Bank PLC - A-(lka) \nNational Development Bank PLC - A-(lka)\n \u0a8a Commercial Bank PLC - A (lka)\n35.3 Liquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial li abilities that are \nsettled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group\u2019s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possi ble, that it will \nalways have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring  unacceptable \nlosses or risking damage to the Group\u2019s reputation.\nThe Group does not concentrate on a single financial institution, thereby minimizing the exposure to liquidity risk through div ersification \nof funding sources. The Group aims to fund investment activities of the individual and Group level by funding the long-term inv estment \nwith long term financial sources and short term investment with short term financing. Where necessary the Group consults the Tr easury \nDepartment and Strategic Business Development Unit in Parent Company for scrutinizing the funding decisions.\nThe Table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.\nAs at 31st March 2023As at 31st March 2023 On DemandOn Demand\nRs.\u2019000Rs.\u2019000Less than Less than \n3 Months3 Months\nRs.\u2019000Rs.\u20190003 to 12 3 to 12 \nMonthsMonths\nRs.\u2019000Rs.\u20190002 to 52 to 5\n years years\nRs.\u2019000Rs.\u2019000>5 years>5 years\nRs.\u2019000Rs.\u2019000TotalTotal\nRs.\u2019000Rs.\u2019000\nGroup\nLease liability on Right-of-Use asset- Land  - 9,619 28,858 153,908 654,111 846,496\nLease liability on Right-of-Use asset- \nBuilding - 3,299 9,897  -  - 13,196\nInterest bearing loans & borrowing  - 965 2,812 2,679  - 6,456\nBank Overdraft 37,423  -  -  -  - 37,423\n 37,423 13,883 41,567 156,587 654,111 903,571\nCompany\nLease liability on Right-of-Use asset- Land  - 9,619 28,858 153,908 654,111 846,496\nLease liability on Right-of-Use asset- \nBuilding - 3,299 9,897  -  - 13,196\nInterest bearing loans & borrowing  - 965 2,812 2,679  - 6,456\nBank Overdraft 37,423  -  -  -  - 37,423\n 37,423 13,883 41,567 156,587 654,111 903,571", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3021, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c7bc698-56c3-40eb-b26c-f6137da1fe39": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c7bc698-56c3-40eb-b26c-f6137da1fe39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "236", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b45e8708-9849-45e2-9a5f-063e0e136fdc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "236", "file_name": "726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_path": "files\\726_1685638811126.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7273625, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "1bfbcfbc774c1e3276a1c344db34169d0a52063af591b453bd63b158a8c29a39", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "234234\nTALAWAKELLE TEA ESTATES PLCTALAWAKELLE TEA ESTATES PLC\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL  REPORT 2022/23 INTEGRATED ANNUAL  REPORT 2022/23Overview\nManagement Discussion and Analysis\nRisk and Governance\nStatement of ESG Performance\nFinancial ReportsFinancial Reports\nAppendices\nAs at 31st March 2022As at 31st March 2022 On DemandOn Demand\nRs.\u2019000Rs.\u2019000Less than Less than \n3 Months3 Months\nRs.\u2019000Rs.\u20190003 to 12 3 to 12 \nMonthsMonths\nRs.\u2019000Rs.\u20190002 to 52 to 5\n years years\nRs.\u2019000Rs.\u2019000>5 years>5 years\nRs.\u2019000Rs.\u2019000TotalTotal\nRs.\u2019000Rs.\u2019000\nGroup\nLease liability on Right-of-Use asset- Land  -   9,010 27,031 108,123 684,718 828,882\nLease liability on Right-of-Use asset- \nBuilding -   3,643 10,929 11,098  -   25,670\nInterest bearing loans & borrowing  -   2,084 6,090 6,609  -   14,783\nBank Overdraft 9,834  -    -    -    -   9,834\n9,834 14,737 44,050 125,830 684,718 879,169\nCompany\nLease liability on Right-of-Use asset- Land  -   9,007 27,019 108,078 684,499 828,603\nLease liability on Right-of-Use asset- \nBuilding -   3,643 10,929 11,098  -   25,670\nInterest bearing loans & borrowing  -   2,084 6,090 6,609  -   14,783\nBank Overdraft 6,759  -    -    -    -   6,759\n6,759 14,734 44,038 125,785 684,499 875,815\n35.4 Market Risk\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in  market prices. \nMarket prices comprise four types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk & other price risk such as equity price risk. Fina ncial instrument \naffected by market risk include loans & borrowings, deposits, available for sale investment & derivative financial instruments.\n35.4.1 Interest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of cha nges in market \ninterest rates. The Group\u2019s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group\u2019s long-term  debt obligations \nwith floating interest rates. The Group manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rat e loans and \nborrowings. The Group has not engaged in any interest rate swap agreements.\nThe Group do not hold long term borrowings with floating interest rates of Nil (2022-Nil) which represents its maximum credit e xposure on \nthese liabilities.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of loans and  borrowings affected. \nWith all other variables held constant, the group\u2019s Profit Before Tax is affected through the impact on floating rate borrowing s as follows:NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n35.
