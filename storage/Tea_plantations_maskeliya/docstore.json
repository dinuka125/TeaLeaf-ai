Separate Managing Agents were also selected to manage each of these Companies and Maskeliya Plantations PLC is one of these companies. \nThe Managing Agent appointed by the Government in June \n1992 was Uva Western Plantations (Pvt) Ltd. In January 1996, the Government offered 51% of the Issued Share Capital of Rs.200 million through the Colombo Stock Exchange to pre- qualified bidders. RPK Management Services (Pvt) Ltd (RPK), a 50:50 joint venture Company between Richard Pieris Company Ltd and John Keells Holdings Ltd being the successful bidder acquired the 51% stake at Rs.21/50 per share. \nIn September 1997, 20% of the Issued Share Capital \nconsisting of 4,000,000 Ordinary Shares was offered to the public at a price of Rs.15/- per share. This offer was over subscribed many times over and on a pro-rata basis shares were allocated to more than 16,000 applicants. Subsequently, 19% of the Company\u2019s Share Capital amounting to 3,800,000 shares was sold through the Colombo Stock Exchange. \nIn December 1997, as the final step of the Government\u2019s \nprivatization programme, the remaining 10% stake consisting 2,000,000 shares were gifted to the employees. Over 17,000 eligible employees qualified for these shares. \nIn February 1998, the Convertible Debentures held by \nKegalle Plantations Ltd (KPL) were converted to 6,976,744 Ordinary Shares. As a result, the Share Capital of the Company increased to Rs.269,767,450 and KPL was allocated 28.6% of the Issued Share Capital \nIn September 2002, the shares held by Kegalle \nPlantations Ltd were sold to RPK Management Services (Pvt) Ltd. As a result RPK\u2019s holdings in Maskeliya Plantations PLC was increased to 17,176,744 ordinary shares or 63.67% holding of the Issued Share Capital. \nOn 31 March 2004, Richard Pieris & Co. PLC bought over \nthe stake of John Keells Holdings PLC in RPK. Thereby RPK became a wholly owned subsidiary of Richard Pieris & Co. PLC and to reflect this change, the name of the Company too was changed as RPC Management Services (Pvt) Ltd. \nSubsequently, RPC Management Services (Pvt) Ltd increased \nits Shareholding of Maskeliya Plantations PLC to 73.48%. Consequent upon a rights issue by Maskeliya Plantations PLC in November 2012 a further increase of its Shareholding up to 83.40% was made by RPC Management Services (Pvt) Ltd.", "mimetype":

Despite a turbulent economic environment and countless obstacles, the Company achieved a remarkable performance with revenue of Rs. 6.2bn and profit before tax of Rs. 1.35bn during this period. \nThese are the highest-ever returns achieved in its \nhistory and demonstrates the Company\u2019s resilience and unwavering commitment towards meeting shareholder expectations. \nEconomy at a Glance\nReeling from the effects of the COVID pandemic, the global economy faced new challenges. Rise in the indebtedness of governments and the Russia-Ukraine war, which resulted in food and energy supply disruptions, are amongst the major hurdles.  Inflation reached 8.7% and is projected to remain at 6.8% in 2023. Many countries faced economic difficulties and measures had to be taken to bring about stability through tightening of monetary and fiscal policies. Global economic growth in 2022 was just 3.5%.  During the financial year-in-review, the economy saw a significant decline with a negative growth rate of 7.8%, affecting performances across the board and reversing post-pandemic recovery. The economic crisis, combined with political instability, led to increased public concern and outcry.\nIn addition to being unable to service its foreign loan \nobligations, the country failed to secure the foreign exchange critically needed to cover imports. This foreign exchange crisis resulted in widespread import curbs. The consequent inconveniences were keenly felt by both citizens and businesses. Disruptions occurred to industries reliant on imported raw material. The rupee depreciated sharply against all major foreign currencies. Twelve-month inflation peaked at 70% in September.\nBy 2023, however, tight monetary and fiscal policies \npaved the way to securing new funding and inflation rates reduced whist the rupee has stabilised.  \nIndustry Overview\nDuring the year, agricultural, forestry, and fishing sectors declined by 4.6%. \nIn 2022, the country\u2019s tea production saw a significant \ndecline of 47.99mn kilograms (16%) compared with the previous year.

The Company continues to invest in employee enhancement measures whilst guaranteeing fair remuneration and a host of benefits. In the year-in- review, a total of Rs. 137 mn was incurred on behalf of employees, in creches, medical expenses, worker welfare, etc.\nFuture Outlook\nThere remains a considerable degree of uncertainty in the recovery of the Sri Lankan as well as the global economy.  How geopolitical tensions caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict are resolved, and the pattern of fiscal and monetary policies around the world, will, no doubt, impact future global economic development. \nWhilst loan inflows have provided comfort, allowing the \nimport of much-needed goods, the management of the trade balance and fiscal deficit will be crucial to bringing the Sri Lankan economy back to a path of recovery. If not, there exists a great risk of the emergence of crises similar to that experienced in 2022. Developing export generating sectors such as plantations will certainly be a step towards achieving positive goals, and the management of exchange rates, in addition to provision of incentives, would be much welcomed.\nRises in temperature due to climatic conditions experienced \nrecently is a cause for concern. If the condition persists, the damage could cut across all plantation companies and hinder future crop generating capacity.\nAcknowledgements\nI wish to thank the Directors and the Management Team for their unstinted support and appreciate the tireless efforts of our employees in achieving the results of the current year.

The deterioration of soil nutrients caused low yields and impacted production capacity in the ensuing year. High-grown, medium-grown and low-grown tea production all declined, by 13.8%, 21.2% and 15.4%, respectively.\nAverage tea prices rose by 105% to Rs. 1,270.50 from \nRs. 619.50 the previous year. Price of high-, medium- and low-grown teas increased by 94.6%, 93.5% and 110.8%, respectively. This surge can be attributed to low quantities and rupee depreciation. \nThe prices of inputs increased steeply during the year. \nThe rupee depreciation and shortages caused by the import restrictions were contributory factors. Utility prices also surged. As a result, the overall cost of production (CoP) escalated. \nWith the stabilisation of the rupee and relaxation of \nimport curbs by the end of the financial year, increases are noted in the crop whilst the NSA has declined. \nMPL Performance\nThe Company achieved revenue of Rs. 6.2bn, the highest-ever recorded in its history and an increase of 54% compared with the previous year. The gross profit improved by 374% to Rs. 1.7bn and profit before tax was Rs. 1.35bn, an increase of 555%. \nDuring the year-in-review, the shortage of fertiliser and \nagrochemicals caused crop output to decline by 22% against the previous year. \nThe NSA of tea increased by 105% to Rs. 1203.75 \ncompared to Rs. 585.56 the previous year. \nWith rise in the cost of raw material, the COP increased \nfrom Rs. 551.18 to Rs. 885.66, a spike of 61%. \nWhilst, with a reduced crop, the NSA and COP increased \nby 105% and 61%, respectively, revenue and cost of sales rose by only 54% and 22%, respectively.\nThe Company closely monitored and controlled its \nexpenditure, thereby containing any increase. The Company continues to maintain its Good Agriculture and Manufacturing Practices, guaranteeing the highest quality of tea production.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SLAuSs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. \nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are \nconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.  \nAs part of an audit in accordance with SLAuSs, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:  \n\u2022 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of \nthe financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. \n\u2022 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal controls of the company.\n\u2022 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n\u2022 Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\u2022 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. \n\u2022 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Company to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the company audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a \nstatement that we have complied with ethical requirements in accordance with the Code of Ethics regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with \ngovernance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\nReport on other legal and regulatory requirements  \nAs required by section 163 (2) of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007, we have obtained all the information and explanations that were required for the audit and, as far as appears from our examination, proper accounting records have been kept by the Company.\nCA Sri Lanka membership number of the engagement \npartner responsible for signing this independent

The arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement. \nCompany as a lessee The Company applies a single recognition and \nmeasurement approach for all leases, except for short term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Company recognises lease liability to make lease payments and right to use of assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.     3.6.4.1Right of Use Assets\nThe Company recognises right to use of assets at the commencement date of a lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right of use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right to use of assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct cost incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentive received. \nRight of use assets are depreciated on a straight-\nline basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets. Lease period of land acquired from JEDB/ SLSPC will be expired in year 2045.  If ownership of the leased asset transferred to the Company at the end of the lease period or the cost reflect the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset as follow: \n(over the remaining lease period) \n3.6.4.2 Lease Liabilities\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the \nCompny recognises lease liability measured at the present value of lease payment to be made over the lease term. The lease payment includes fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentive receivables, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payment also includes the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Company and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising the option to terminate. \nVariable lease payments that do not depend on \nan index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

Immature biological assets are those that have not yet attained harvestable specifications. Tea plantation and nurseries are classified as biological assets. \nBiological assets are further classified as bearer \nbiological assets and consumable biological assets. Bearer biological asset includes tea trees, those that are not intended to be sold or harvested, however used to grow for harvesting agricultural produce from such biological assets. Consumable biological assets includes managed timber trees those that are to be harvested as agricultural produce or sold as biological assets.\n3.6.7.1 Bearer Biological Assets\nThe bearer biological assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any, in terms of LKAS 16 \u2013 Property, Plant & Equipment. \nThe cost of land preparation, rehabilitation, new \nplanting, replanting, crop diversification, inter planting and fertilising, etc., incurred between the time of planting and harvesting (when the planted area attains maturity), are classified as immature plantations. \nThese immature plantations are shown at \ndirect costs plus attributable overheads. The expenditure incurred on bearer biological assets (Tea) which comes into bearing during the year, is transferred to mature plantations. \n3.6.7.2 Infilling Cost on Bearer Biological \nAssets\nThe land development costs incurred in the form of infilling have been capitalized to the relevant mature field, if it increases the expected future benefits from that field, beyond its pre-infilling performance assessment.

Expenditure incurred on consumable biological assets (managed timber trees) is measured on initial recognition and at the end of each reporting period at its fair value less cost to sell in terms of LKAS 41. The cost is treated as approximation to fair value of young plants as the impact on biological transformation of such plants to price during this period is immaterial. The fair value of timber trees are measured using DCF method taking into consideration the current market prices of timber, applied to expected timber content of a tree at the maturity by an independent professional valuer.

Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.\nThe Company\u2019s financial assets at amortised \ncost includes trade receivables and amounts due from related parties.\n3.7.1.3 Derecognition\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Company of similar financial assets) is derecognised when:\n\u2022 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired.\n\u2022 The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a \u2018pass-through\u2019 arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\nWhen the Company has transferred its rights to \nreceive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Company\u2019s continuing involvement in the asset. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.\nContinuing involvement that takes the form \nof a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Company could be required to repay.\n3.7.1.4 Impairment of Financial Assets\nThe Company recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.\nECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit \nexposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).\n3.7.2 Financial Liabilities\n3.7.2.1 Initial recognition and measurement\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.

Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.\nFinancial liabilities comprise interest bearing \nloans and borrowings, trade payables, other payables and amounts due to related parties.\n3.7.2.3 Derecognition  \nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.\nWhen an existing financial liability is replaced by \nanother from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the Profit or loss.\n3.7.3 Offsetting of Financial Instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n3.8 Inventories\nAgricultural Produce Harvested from Biological \nAssets \nAgricultural produce harvested from biological \nassets are measured at their fair value less cost to sell at the point of harvest. The finished and semi-finished inventories from agricultural produce are valued by adding the cost of conversion to the fair value of agricultural produce. \nFinish goods manufactured from agricultural \nproduce of biological assets\nThese are valued at the lower of cost and \nestimated net realisable value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow-moving items. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price at which stocks can be sold in the ordinary course of business after allowing for cost of realisation and/or cost of conversion from their existing state to saleable condition. \n Input Material, Spares and Consumables\nAt actual cost on weighted average basis.\n3.9 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets\nThe Company assesses, at each reporting date, \nwhether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Company estimates the asset\u2019s recoverable amount. An asset\u2019s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset\u2019s or cash-generating unit\u2019s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.

When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future \ncash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators.\nThe Company bases its impairment calculation \non detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Company\u2019s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.\nImpairment losses of continuing operations, \nincluding impairment on inventories, are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset, except for properties previously revalued with the revaluation taken to OCI. For such properties, the impairment is recognised in OCI up to the amount of any previous revaluation.\nFor assets excluding goodwill, an assessment \nis made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Company estimates the asset\u2019s or CGU\u2019s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset\u2019s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.\n3.10  Trade and Other Receivables\nTrade and other receivables are stated at their \nestimated realisable amounts inclusive of provisions for bad and doubtful debts.\n3.11 Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.

When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the Profit or Loss Statement net of any reimbursement.\n3.13 Employees Benefits\n(a)  Defined Contribution Plans - Provident Funds \nand Trust Fund \nA defined contribution plan is a post-\nemployment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.

The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually using the \u201cProjected Unit Credit\u201d method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows using the interest rates that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related liability.

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\n3.17 Deferred Income\n3.17.1 Grants and Subsidies\nGovernment grants are recognised where there \nis reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and all attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income over the period necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate. Where the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as deferred income and released to income in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset.\nWhere the Company receives non-monetary \ngrants, the asset and the grant are recorded gross at nominal amounts and released to the Statement of Profit or Loss over the expected useful life and pattern of consumption of the benefit of the underlying asset by equal annual instalments. Where loans or similar assistance are provided by governments or related institutions with an interest rate below the current applicable market rate, the effect of this favourable interest is regarded as additional government grant.\nGrants related to Property, Plant & Equipment \nother than grants received for forestry are initially deferred and allocated to income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the related Property, Plant & Equipment as follows: \nFINANCIAL REPORTS   | YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023\n66\nMASKELIYA PLANTATIONS PLC", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3926, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2a94323-723a-49bc-8e9a-f28095193ace": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2a94323-723a-49bc-8e9a-f28095193ace", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "723_1693476523167.pdf", "file_path": "files\\723_1693476523167.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3192181, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d34cdf7e-758b-4d99-a3a2-d297f83a0376", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "723_1693476523167.pdf", "file_path": "files\\723_1693476523167.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3192181, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "47dacbc4d666844b91f05cc344a24a7a973f2eee0be9c4928a85e90ba156e8da", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Notes to the Financial Statements   \nYear Ended 31 March 2023\nAssets are amortised over their useful lives or \nunexpired lease period, whichever is less.\nBuildings     40 years\nGrants received for forestry are initially deferred \nand credited to income once when the related blocks of trees are harvested.\n3.18   Statement of Profit or Loss \nFor the purpose of presentation of Statement of \nProfit or Loss, the function of expenses method is adopted, as it represents fairly the elements of the company\u2019s performance.\n3.18.1 Revenue \nRevenue from contracts with customers\nRevenue is recognised to the extent that it \nis probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty. Revenue is recognised upon satisfaction of performance obligation.  \nThe company is in the business of cultivation, \nmanufacture and sale of black tea and other crops (Plantation Produce). Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods. The company has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements, because it typically controls the goods before transferring them to the customer.\nSale of Plantation produce \nRevenue from sale of plantation produce is \nrecognized at the point in time when the control of the goods is transferred to the customer.

USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS\nThe preparation of Financial Statements \nin conformity with SLFRS/LKAS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that influence the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Hence, actual experience and results may differ from these judgments and estimates.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are \nreviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period and any future periods affected.\nInformation about significant areas of \nestimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements is included in the following notes:\n\u2022 Note 14.2 \u2013  Consumable Biological Assets\n\u2022 Note 24 - Measurement of the Retirement Benefit Obligations\n\u2022 Note 25 \u2013 Deferred Taxation4.1 Taxation\nCurrent Tax\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities \nare measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the countries where the Company operates and generates taxable income.\nAccording to The Inland Revenue (Amended) \nBill, to amend the Inland Revenue Act, No. 24 of 2017, Agro Farming is exempt from income tax for a period of 5 years effective from 01 April 2019 and Agro processing is liable at 14% with the 25% rebate. The amendment to the IRD act on 19th December 2022, company is liable to the rate of 14% for the first six months where balancing period tax at 30% by segregating the business income using the pro-rata basis. \nDeferred Tax\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. As per the Inland Revenue (Amended) bill issued on 18.03.2021, company is identified Separately business income as agro farming & agro processing for the purpose of calculating income tax liability therefore, the company has separated assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2023 as Agro farming and Agro processing for the deferred tax purpose.\n4.2 Retirement Benefit Obligations\nThe present value of the retirement benefit obligation determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate; future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting period.\nIn determining the appropriate discount rate, \nmanagement considers the interest rates of \nYEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023 | FINANCIAL REPORTS\n69\nMASKELIYA PLANTATIONS PLC", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4198, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30c20567-630c-4135-b171-467eaeca8701": {"__data__": {"id_": "30c20567-630c-4135-b171-467eaeca8701", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "723_1693476523167.pdf", "file_path": "files\\723_1693476523167.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3192181, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24b5849d-824d-4c57-8a55-cbed146a28e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "723_1693476523167.pdf", "file_path": "files\\723_1693476523167.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3192181, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "2acb595fb380b368819913ca19da2fdbc852335cf3b7be9fdffd7ceb058829ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Notes to the Financial Statements   \nYear Ended 31 March 2023\nSri Lanka government bonds with maturities \ncorresponding to the expected duration of the defined benefit obligation.

The growth of the trees is determined by various biological factors that are highly unpredictable. Any change to the assumptions will impact to the fair value of biological assets. Key assumptions and sensitivity analysis of the biological assets are given in the Note 14.2.\n4.4 IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over \nIncome Tax Treatment\nThe Interpretation addresses the accounting \nfor income taxes when tax treatments involve uncertainty that affects the application of LKAS 12 Income Taxes. The Company applies significant judgement in identifying uncertainties over income tax treatments. Since the Company operates in a complex environment, it assessed whether the Interpretation had an impact on its financial statements. The Company determined that it is probable that its tax treatments will be accepted by the taxation authorities. The Interpretation did not have an impact on the financial statements of the Company.\n4.5 Leases - Estimating the Incremental \nBorrowing Rate\nThe Company cannot readily determine the \ninterest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing rate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. The IBR therefore reflects what the Company \u2018would have to pay\u2019, which requires estimation when no observable rates are available or when they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease. The Company estimates the IBR using observable inputs (such as market interest rates) when available and is required to make certain entity-specific estimates such as the company\u2019s stand-alone credit rating.\n5.  STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET \nEFFECTIVE\nThe new and amended standards and \ninterpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group\u2019s financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these new and amended standards and interpretations, if applicable, when they become effective.\n5.1  SLFRS 17 \u2013 Insurance contracts\nSLFRS 17 is a comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure. Once effective, SLFRS 17 will replace SLFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (SLFRS 4) that was issued in 2005. SLFRS 17 applies to all types of insurance contracts (i.e., life, non-life, direct insurance and re-insurance), regardless of the type of entities that issue them, as well as to certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary participation features. A few scope exceptions will apply. The overall objective of SLFRS 17 is to provide an accounting model for insurance contracts that is more useful and consistent for insurers. In contrast to the requirements in SLFRS 4, which are largely based on grandfathering previous local accounting policies, SLFRS 17 provides a comprehensive model for insurance contracts, covering all relevant accounting aspects. The core of SLFRS 17 is the general model, supplemented by:\n-  A specific adaptation for contracts with \ndirect participation features (the variable fee approach)\n-  A simplified approach (the premium allocation \napproach) mainly for short-duration contracts\nSLFRS 17 is effective for annual reporting \nperiods beginning on or after 1 January \nFINANCIAL REPORTS   | YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023\n70\nMASKELIYA PLANTATIONS PLC", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4175, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e990a58b-9f69-4994-96b8-c178f5f98042": {"__data__": {"id_": "e990a58b-9f69-4994-96b8-c178f5f98042", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "723_1693476523167.pdf", "file_path": "files\\723_1693476523167.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3192181, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "05977917-7f68-4ca4-b51d-a4eb437f58c8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "723_1693476523167.pdf", "file_path": "files\\723_1693476523167.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3192181, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "ae454c2468c84ca2ed713c0fc6a06b4758d1ac2f46e5985134ae1c7f55a25067", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Notes to the Financial Statements   \nYear Ended 31 March 2023\n2023, with comparative figures required.

The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group.\n5.2 Amendments to LKAS 8 - Definition of \nAccounting Estimates\nThe amendments clarify the distinction between \nchanges in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. Also, they clarify how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates. The amended standard clarifies that the effects on an accounting estimate of a change in an input or a change in a measurement technique are changes in accounting estimates if they do not result from the correction of prior period errors\nThe amendments are effective for annual \nreporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. Earlier application is permitted.\n5.3 Amendments to LKAS 12 Taxation \n- Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction\nThe amendments clarify that where payments \nthat settle a liability are deductible for tax purposes, it is a matter of judgement (having considered the applicable tax law) whether such deductions are attributable for tax purposes to the liability recognised in the financial statements (and interest expense) or to the related asset component (and interest expense). This judgement is important in determining whether any temporary differences exist on initial recognition of the asset and liability.\nAlso, under the amendments, the initial \nrecognition exception does not apply to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. It only applies if the recognition of a lease asset and lease liability (or decommissioning liability and decommissioning asset component) give rise to taxable and deductible temporary differences that are not equal.The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.\n5.4 Amendments to LKAS 1 - Disclosure of \nAccounting Policies\nAmendments to LKAS 1 and IFRS Practice \nStatement 2 Making Materiality Judgements, provides guidance and examples to help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting policy disclosures.

The valuation was carried out by Mr W M Chandrasena \nFIV (SL) MRICS (UK) accredited Chartered Valuation Surveyor using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) methods. In ascertaining the fair value of timber valuer has considered the different species, size, condition and location of timber trees. The future cash flows are determined by reference to current timber prices without considering the future increase of timber prices.              \nThe valuations, as presented in the external valuation models based on net present values, take into account the long term exploitation \nof the timber plantations. Because of the inherent uncertainty associated with the valuation at fair value of the biological assets due to the volatility of the variables, their carrying value may differ from their realisable value.  Hence, the sensitivity analysis regarding selling price and discount rate variations as included in this note allows an investor to reasonably challenge the financial impact of the assumptions used in the SLFRS 13 against his own assumptions.\nFINANCIAL REPORTS   | YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023\n78\nMASKELIYA PLANTATIONS PLC", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3327, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3a6b119-309b-4a18-abcc-9344fbb04438": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3a6b119-309b-4a18-abcc-9344fbb04438", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "723_1693476523167.pdf", "file_path": "files\\723_1693476523167.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3192181, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cd3f57bb-ffda-46d3-aa43-9b97227dbc42", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "723_1693476523167.pdf", "file_path": "files\\723_1693476523167.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3192181, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "53c97c165456445a2f1803fd697fd3c4a11b9acfb5cc7e9aa38b1a24ae084e2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "14.2.1 Information About Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) \n \nNon Financial \nAsset Valuation \nTechniqueUnobservable \nInputsRange of Unobservable Inputs\n(Probability weighted average.)Relationship of Unobservable \nInputs to Fair Value\n2023 2022\nConsumable Managed Biolog -\nical AssetsDCF Discounting Rate 19% 19% The higher the discount rate the lower the fair Value.\nOptimum rota -\ntion (Maturity) 30 - 40 Years  30 - 40 Years Lower the rotation Period, the higher the fair value.\nPrice per cu ft Rs.250/= to Rs.800/=Rs.250/= to Rs.800/=The higher the price the higher the fair Value.\nOther key factors considered in valuation                       1.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES      \n The Company\u2019s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and borrowings, trade and other payables. \nThe main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company\u2019s operations and to provide guarantees to support its operations. The Company has loan and other receivables, trade and other receivables, and cash and cash equivalent that arise directly from its operations.         \n38.1 Financial Risk Management Framework        \n The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company\u2019s financial risk management framework which includes developing and monitoring the Company\u2019s financial risk management policies.  \n38.2 Credit Risk        \n Credit Risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company\u2019s if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arise principally from the Company\u2019s receivable from customers. \n38.2.1 Trade and other Receivables        \n The Company\u2019s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers the demographics of the Company\u2019s customer base, including the default risk of the industry and the country in which the customers operate, as these factors may have an influence on credit risk.\n The Company reviews external ratings and bank references of the customer when available. Purchase limits are established for each customer, which are reviewed quarterly. In monitoring credit risk, customers are categorised according to their credit characteristics, including whether they are an individual or legal entity, whether they are a wholesale or retail customer, geographical location, industry, aging profile, maturity and existence of previous financial difficulties. The Company establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables.\n The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables at the reporting date is Rs.485 Mn  (2021/22 \u2013 Rs. 299 Mn).                                 \n Maskeliya Plantations PLC has a minimal credit risk of its trade receivables as the repayment is guaranteed within seven days by the Tea Auction System. \nYEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023 | FINANCIAL REPORTS\n91\nMASKELIYA PLANTATIONS PLC", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3634, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "055ff4d9-f33b-4f47-afff-86d7e3c82f44": {"__data__": {"id_": "055ff4d9-f33b-4f47-afff-86d7e3c82f44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "723_1693476523167.pdf", "file_path": "files\\723_1693476523167.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3192181, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8bc74563-ac16-4af2-a2d6-c7acefc69045", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "723_1693476523167.pdf", "file_path": "files\\723_1693476523167.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3192181, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "7e62172d96b9a1127595f0c409abe005b45d6d6cbad5cbf15bdf00725bbcc6df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Company\u2019s main customers (Brokers) have been transacting with the Company more than 10 years, and none of these cus -\ntomers\u2019 balances have been written off or are credit -impaired at the reporting date.

For individual customers, the Company has a policy of writing off the gross carrying amount when the financial asset is 365 days past due based on historical experience of recoveries of similar assets. F or \ncorporate customers, the Company individually makes an assessment with respect to the timing and amount of write -off based on \nwhether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery.

Liquidity Risk         \n Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company\u2019s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company\u2019s reputation.\n The details of liqudity risk is given in the Note 23.3.      \n38.4. Market Risk        \n Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market prices comprise four types of risk: interest rate risk & other price risk such as equity price risk. Financial instrument affected by market risk include loans & borrowings, deposits & derivative financial instruments.\n38.4.1 Interest Rate Risk         \n Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
